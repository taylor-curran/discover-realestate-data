Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

My boys are my world, and I am proud of both of them. 
I am also an Arbonne Independent Consultant. Arbonne provides pure, safe and beneficial health and beauty products. Our products are made for those that don't want to use harsh chemicals and want true results in their health and their looks! 

As I got closer to having to start paying for my boys college, I decided to launch my vacation rental business with my Downtown Salem Loft. a 2400 sq ft ""New York Style Loft"" Apartment in the oldest historical building in downtown Salem.  I quickly realized this was my nitch, I was great at hosting guests and providing beautiful, affordable lodging in our Capitol City and Greater Willamette Valley and so it began. My vacation rental company is SalemStays. Currently I have 7 vacation rentals in Salem, 1 In Independence Oregon towards the coast and wine country and 1 in Stayton Oregon on the trail to Silver Falls State park and the Oregon Gardens! I love the hospitality business and supplying guests with beautiful, comfortable, and usable spaces to stay in for a much more reasonable price than staying in a hotel. 

I love to get to know all my guests and to make new connections. I hope you stay with me if you ever come to Salem OR or the Greater Willamette Valley.
