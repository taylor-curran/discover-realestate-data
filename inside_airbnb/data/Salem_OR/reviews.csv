1159564,6502395,2013-08-14,7776893,Aaron,"Roberta was a great hostess who provided all the amenities listed and then some. She made us feel comfortable and maintained our privacy, although we did hang out on the porch a few times, and shared dinner. Her two dogs were very friendly and that made us feel at home too. We recommend anyone to stay at Roberta's when in Salem. We couldn't have beaten the value."
1159564,6928737,2013-08-30,143866,Inge,I had a very nice stay with Roberta. The room and bed were comfortable. The house was lovely and in a quiet neighborhood. There is a pretty garden with fruit trees. The plums were the best ever and I could take as many as I wanted. I would stay here again.
2894591,14254207,2014-06-15,315272,Elaine,"Sue was a very welcoming and went to great lengths to make my stay comfortable. There were some ""hotel""-like touches that she had prepared ahead of of time, like mini toiletries in the bathroom, and water and chocolate on the nightstand. She'd even thoughtfully purchased some items for breakfast, knowing that I would be leaving early the next day.

The house is located in a quiet neighborhood about a mile away from a commercial area where where a number of stores/restaurants are located. I did not hear any traffic/dogs barking/etc and the bed was very comfortable."
2894591,14302027,2014-06-16,6182515,Herb'S Daughter,"Sue was a very great hostess!  The house was beautiful and immaculate!  She provided all sorts of thoughtful touches and even imported soap and shampoo like a regular bed and breakfast.  The home is in a very quiet part of Salem and backs onto a lush greenway. 

She was very available and provided an excellent dinner recommendation. 
The bed was incredibly soft.  We'd go there again."
2894591,15009379,2014-06-30,3516319,Seth,"Sue is a great host and has a lovely clean, quiet home that I enjoyed visiting. You'll be staying in a very comfortable room with your own shower across the hall.  Sue made me a lovely breakfast to send me on my way the next morning. She gets my highest recommendation. "
2894591,15547706,2014-07-11,437925,Tiffany,"Sue was a kind, generous, and welcoming host, and the guest bedroom provided for us was an extension of her hospitality. Her home was immaculate and inviting, and as other Airbnb guests have stated, sprinkled with amenities such as complimentary water bottles, truffles, and use of nice toiletries. Sue allowed us to bring our dog and made the extra effort to ensure there would be no confrontations between our dog and her cats! Sue offered us a plethora of breakfast options and sent us on the road with a box of delicious breakfast pastries from a local bakery; morning conversation rounded out a wonderful experience for us. We can't recommend her highly enough!"
2894591,15741775,2014-07-14,16914477,Chris,"Great experience here. Accommodations were clean and comfortable. Sues attention to details like wrapped soap, water bottle, and a clean folded set of towels is reflective of her hospitality. "
2894591,16123017,2014-07-22,6483814,Jerry,"Sue was a most gracious host and made efforts above and beyond the call to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We had some lovely conversations and enjoyed the peaceful neighborhood. I highly recommend her to everyone.

Thanks, Sue and we hope your kitty's leg is well on the mend.

2894591,16535132,2014-07-28,18886018,Geoffrey,"Wonderful room in a cozy house. Sue was a great host, I enjoyed my brief stay tremendously. Highly recommend."
2894591,16647477,2014-07-30,16758662,Kayl,"I stayed at Sue's BnB on more than one occasion. The home checked off well as a place for me to stay. Meals were well cooked, nice big screen tv with hbo, computer for use, clean bathroom (she provided a soap bar), and comfortable room (even during hot month of july). The home is a quiet neighborhood, near a delightful park in the hills. What was most appreciated was the fact that Sue was so inviting. She let me put my bike in her garage, and gave me a garage opener. My only critique would be there is no wi-fi (she mentioned she might get wifi there soon). "
2894591,16749388,2014-08-01,11134176,Steven,"Great stay at Sue's house. Wonderful bed, beautiful bathroom. Fresh fruit on my cereal and a nice big cup of coffee. We had a great chat as well. Thanks, Sue!"
2894591,16925867,2014-08-04,18020318,Cheryl,"Sue is a lovely, warm and welcoming hostess with a beautiful home in the woods.  Great setting.  Everything is neat and clean and she made us feel right at home.  She was most helpful in getting our things out of the fridge and freezer when we left in the early am to be on time for an event in Albany.  The pastries were yummy.  Regretted we could not stay longer.  Thanks Sue!"
2894591,17328240,2014-08-10,18456052,Margy,"Sue was very accommodating to our schedule, we came in late.  She even suggested good restaurants near by to eat at.  The neighborhood was amazing and very beautiful.  She is set at the bottom of a very picturesque hill.  She has beautiful wildlife and animals in her backyard.  She also has  couple house cats, which were very sweet and loving (I loved being with  them).   The house was very clean and cozy.  We really felt at home with Sue.  Out of all of the places on this trip, Sues was the homiest.  We really enjoyed chatting with Sue and she was a great hostess.  She woke up in the morning and had breakfast going for us and made sure there was something for both of us.  The only improvements we could suggest was that we personally felt the bed was too soft.  As a small heads up, we are bit of night owls and our room was right next to  hers, so we had to be cognizant of the fact we had a shared wall and had to use headphones to watch a movie."
2894591,19703908,2014-09-16,12234254,Debbie + Kirk,"Kirk says his stay has been great!  Sue welcomes you into her home, like family.  She is a wonderful host!  Wonderful neighborhood.  
The bed is as good as a fine hotel or better, right along with the pillows.

Area is easy access to everything in Salem."
2894591,21314472,2014-10-14,22059304,Ben,Great. Recommended.
2894591,21735343,2014-10-22,12433552,Anne,"Excellent, thank you Sue, great neighborhood, super clean, most awesome bed!, great company, sweet treats, just so perfect, thank you so much for opening your home to travelers, it is a great retreat spot in Salem."
2894591,22129454,2014-10-30,22937427,Sherpa,"   Our stay in Salem with our host Sue Peck was enjoyable and very peaceful. The wooded area lent itself to a feeling of being in a private nature reserve. Our hostess was very gracious and made our stay relaxing and restful. Our bedroom was clean and comfortable. The breakfast the following morning was an unexpected serendipity.
   We would gladly stay  with our host again when in the Salem area and would recommend others reserving  with her as well.

2894591,22612551,2014-11-10,3480225,Adina,"Sue has been a very friendly host! Her house is full of light, comfortable, clean and set in a very beautiful neighborhood with forest and wild life! 
She is concerned with details to make you feel welcome ( water bottle and chocolate in the bedroom, hotel like toiletries in the bathroom, rich breakfast with cereals, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea  ) ! The bathroom is right across the hall  from the bedroom door and has a nice big shower cabin! 
She has two cats, but there is no cat hair around the house whatsoever!
She was very nice to even give me a ride in town to meet my friend one day!
Thank you very much, Sue"
2894591,22687477,2014-11-11,23458951,Steve,"This was my first experience with Airbnb.  Since we were only going to be in Salem one night, my wife & I decided to try it  out.  We had a wonderful experience!  We found Sue to be a delightful hostess, her home is warm, inviting and nicely decorated. And the bedroom and bed were both very comfortable. My wife & I both had a very restful night sleep.  We selected this listing based upon previous reviews, and found them to be both accurate and very helpful in making our selection.  We had a relaxing stay and would not hesitate to return again in the future if given the opportunity.  Thank you Sue.  We give our highest recommendation to you."
2894591,23292943,2014-11-28,2082721,Jody,Sue has a beautiful house nestled next to a woodsy area. It was so beautiful to watch all of the birds coming to feed. Her place is impeccably clean and well appointed. The bedroom was comfy and perfect as was our private bathroom. We wanted for nothing. A Great experience and the perfect way for us to visit family for Thanksgiving. 
2894591,23419928,2014-11-30,22549607,Alex,"She is amazing! What a gracious host and a really good person. I know that is strange to say without knowing someone very long. But she truly opened her house and herself as well. This is important in a trip to a place where you do not know anyone, it truly puts a good vibe right off the bat to the trio. The breakfast was great and the view and conversation went well with it. I appreciate all the warm hospitality and I will be back!!"
2894591,25898195,2015-01-29,23257638,Amy,"Sue was a fantastic host! She was incredibly hospitable. It was a very friendly environment.

Her home is spotless and in a lovely setting.  She has resident cats which were a treat for me.  The room was warm and cozy with a very comfortable bed.
2894591,28195255,2015-03-19,28312860,Mary Ann,"Sue is very personable and gracious.  Her home is quiet, clean and comfortable.  I would stay there again. "
2894591,28453570,2015-03-23,13699281,Jennifer,Sue was unusually welcoming and friendly. She insisted upon staying up until 11pm to greet us after our long drive. She offered to help with our luggage and made sure we had everything we needed or wanted throughout our stay. Her house is very clean and organized and in a pretty location looking out on woods. 
2894591,28617594,2015-03-27,5592149,Kelsey,"Sue has a lovely home in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood with two sweet kitties and a wonderful backyard view full of squirrels and birds. Her home is very clean and inviting and Sue was so kind and wonderful to talk to and even stayed up very late to great me when I arrived.  She made me feel right at home in Salem and even had some lovely local treats in the room for me. The room and bed were extremely comfy and I had a wonderful stay. I highly recommend Sue's place to stay if you are traveling through Salem. "
2894591,29248278,2015-04-05,14998445,Christopher,"My buddy and I stayed at Sue's place for 1 night, and would definitely do it again. 
She is a wonderfull person and host, and she opened her home like we were family, right from the start. She provided us with treats and drinks while we told stories and watched the sportschannels.
We also got a lot of local advise for our road-trip, we recommend to anyone who goes trough Salem, to stay at Sue's."
2894591,29591002,2015-04-09,6955867,Alan,"What a great Salem place. Plenty green forest and river. Close to the natural food stores and good pubs.
Sue was like right away family, someone to be glad to be with. And her place - so clean and homey. Really enjoyed the cat friends inside and the birds and squirrels outside. Sue and her place is an excellent choice."
2894591,29645687,2015-04-10,30613863,Cristina,"Sue is a sweet and kind lady, and we enjoyed talking to her during at our stay.  We felt very welcomed at her house.  She demonstrated to be a very patient and understanding person when my daughter dropped her coffee in the carpet by accident. Her house is very tidy, cozy and homy.  It is nice to see out the windows as the house property is surrounded by forest, and you can see birds and squirrels.  The bathroom was very clean.  The bed was very confortable, and the room size was large enough.  In the morning she provided us with a delicious coffee cake that she got at a special local bakery. "
2894591,29886113,2015-04-13,15809141,"Thomas (""Andy"")",Sue was a great host. She is also a charming person.  Her home is lovely and spotless in a very nice neighborhood. The room is directly across the hallway from the guest bathroom which is very convenient. And she makes great coffee. I will definitely stay with Sue again next time I am in Salem.

We will surely stay with Sue the next time we are in Salem."
2894591,30575957,2015-04-24,31028844,Robyn,"A really pretty neighborhood with a delightful host.  Reasonably close to downtown Salem, and Sue's home is clean, cozy and very quiet.  There are lovely views from the living room windows of all the squirrels, birds and cats in the woods."
2894591,31014402,2015-04-30,31731984,Ariane,Sue was a gracious host. She made us feel very welcome. Her home is very cozy and the backyard was so beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and made for a good nights sleep. Sue even talked sports with my hubby:). Definitely recommend her place.
2894591,31749029,2015-05-09,32599363,Sandra,"Sue is a wonderful host with a very nice home to share with fellow travelers. I enjoy my stay with Sue and our conversations. The house is exactly as what Sue describes, a quiet and cozy home, that I had the privilege of staying during my short visit to the Salem area. "
2894591,32516024,2015-05-19,26006184,Lisl,Sue was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome and comfortable! Her house and guestroom/-bathroom are spotless and very nicely appointed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!  
2894591,32764577,2015-05-21,4256178,Jennifer,Staying with Sue was great. She was accommodating even with my later than expected arrival. The room was just as pictured and Sue even sets aside a small bar of locally made soap for her Airbnb guests. The whole stay went easily and I would recommend staying with Sue.
2894591,33126790,2015-05-25,29931723,Ashley,"Sue was a wonderful host, she made me feel welcome and comfortable. We had some great conversation and meals together. I'll be staying again in a few weeks! "
2894591,33612405,2015-05-30,33293320,Jolynn,"Sue was an exceptional host. Her home was, as listed, quiet, cozy and oh so cute! She was extremely responsive to my emails and graciously allowed me a midnight arrival and an early Saturday morning departure, even though they're both super inconvenient. Her private guest room was clean, well lit and neutrally decorated. The bed was crazy comfortable! The private bathroom was also very clean and she kindly gifted me a bar of specially made soap for use during my stay. 
"
2894591,34365266,2015-06-07,34589083,Gina,I didn't stay with Sue but reserve a stay for an other person.  Sue was so nice and went out of her way to make this guest comfortable and welcomed.  Her home us lovely and clean.  Very nice garden and surrounding areas
2894591,34748518,2015-06-11,10952700,Meghan,Lovely house that was very clean and well loved. Thoughtful hostess who was very accommodating with offering breakfast / coffee and tea. And some very sweet cats. Nice leafy neighborhood.
2894591,35208227,2015-06-16,25404265,Luanne,"She was friendly, showed us to a welcoming clean room and bathroom, pointed out the breakfast items (delicious) in the kitchen, and we were delighted with the fresh flowers and chocolate truffles in our room.  She also gave us perfect suggestions of things to do.
The reality was even better than the description, and the neighborhood is beautiful, safe and quiet.
"
2894591,35569546,2015-06-20,29931723,Ashley,"Great time again at Sue's place. She is a wonderful host and cook, with a comfortable and clean home."
2894591,45460294,2015-09-03,29251294,Suzanne,"I stayed with Sue all summer, and I had a wonderful experience.  Her home is extremely nice and inviting.  Her home is also very clean.  I loved the room that I stayed in.  I thought the bed was extremely comfortable.  Sue was a real pleasure to stay with.  I enjoyed having someone fun to talk to when my day was over.  I am positive that when I go back, I will be going to visit Sue again.  Plus, I enjoyed Sue's cooking.  :)  Thank you for such a wonderful summer and all the  laughs!!!"
2894591,45645052,2015-09-04,4843659,Katherine,"I had a wonderful experience at Sue's home.  Sue is delightful and welcoming, and her home is lovely, very clean and comfortable."
2894591,45703464,2015-09-05,19631566,Robert,"Sue is a great hostess and provides very comfortable accommodations. She was able to accommodate our arrival check-in time by having a family member meet us, and warned us about some construction that could have made getting to her house a little challenging for a first-time visitor. After checking in, we were out a little late, and Sue stayed up late to greet us and socialize for a while. 

She no problem welcoming our puppy into her house, which was a huge plus for us. All in all, I'd thoroughly recommend Sue's home. We don't have a reason to go back to Salem any time soon, but we rather wish we did."
2894591,45903854,2015-09-06,43213886,Katie,"We had a lovely stay at Sue's home. We were not there for very long, but she was friendly and made us feel welcome. The room was clean and the house was in a quiet neighborhood. My friend and I had to leave early the next morning, but Sue offered breakfast to take on the road with us. Again, we had a perfect stay and could not have asked for more. "
2894591,46907811,2015-09-14,189461,LinMarie,"Sue's welcome began with helping me navigate the road construction and detours enroute to her home, and ended with our sharing shrimp tacos and a cliffhanger Sunday night NFL game. 

Sue's sweet space is definitely as billed, quiet and cozy, comfortable and in a gorgeous serene wooded environment. Her two kitties, Mr. Big and Cricket, are dear personalities, too. 

Her home reflects her family, her travels, and her passions, and I enjoyed getting to know her and learn about the city she's called home for 30 years. 

I can't recommend Sue enough as a host, right down to the decadent chocolate truffle and locally made natural soaps. "
2894591,47236224,2015-09-16,10952700,Meghan,"Sue is such a lovely host and a treat to stay with. She is friendly, warm, and really considerate. At the same time, if I need to curl up and work she is very accommodating. Her house is lovely, clean, and fresh. She has two sweet cats. I love staying with Sue! I just wish she wasn't always booked. :)"
2894591,47829216,2015-09-21,327297,David,"This was a very restful retreat, we loved the open welcome from Sue and her wonderful hospitality from the great coffee to the restful, delightful, quiet bedroom plus the animated squirrels and birds which filled the outside with a symphony of delightful entertainment from the beautiful picturesque windows of the dinning area. A wonderful host and superb stay, both close to parks and Salem Central."
2894591,47942756,2015-09-21,39977197,Phelan,"Sue was extremely gracious. In fact, out of all of the AirBnB places we went to (all were great btw), Sue's was the best! She and her cats were extremely accommodating and we loved the atmosphere of her home. Sue always had clean towels on hand and even supplied us with individual boutique soap bars and truffles to snack on! She even made us breakfast fruit muffins, sliced oranges, and coffee while we thoroughly enjoyed eating breakfast while watching birds and squirrels feed in her well established backyard.

We would highly recommend staying here as her experience with AirBnB and her hospitality were beyond reproach. Thanks Sue!"
2894591,48369972,2015-09-25,3676259,Sarah,"Best Airbnb Host Ever! We went out to dinner, so much fun! Also she did my laundry which I could not believe! If there was 10 stars she would receive everyone!"
2894591,48419395,2015-09-26,42646951,Austin,"Sue was very nice and her home was clean and welcoming. There were lovely extras such as homemade soap and chocolate truffles. The quiet, and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, made for a great night sleep. "
2894591,48646999,2015-09-27,23398723,Shelby,"Sue was great about my later in the evening arrival time. True to her profile, and a few of her reviews, we spent a little time watching some college football games finish up , and she was very kind about listening to some of my day which was spent with my son's college soccer team at a game. I was exhausted; so was happy to go to bed in the very comfortable bed!! As mentioned, there was a most delicious giant truffle, and a spotless bathroom with plenty of towels. I left early for another game; will be back in a couple weeks to enjoy some more conversation with Sue , and enjoy her home set in the trees a little more. "
2894591,49692550,2015-10-05,5023454,Carole,"Sue was truly the perfect host.  She was kind, gracious, and considerate.  And her home is fabulous.  The description was on point; breakfast was a delight.  I highly recommend this listing!!"
2894591,49957015,2015-10-07,10952700,Meghan,"Sue is one of my favorite hosts, and I am lucky enough to stay with her again and again for a reason. As always, a warm and welcoming stay. "
2894591,50726365,2015-10-13,9446593,Michael,The minute I walked in to Sue's house I felt at home. Her house is so cozy and she is such a nice host. I really enjoyed just hanging out and watching football and NASCAR with her. I would definitely stay again! 
2894591,50885146,2015-10-15,35078001,Donald,"Sue was an excellent hostess.  She showed us all around her house and we sat and visited for a while and she made us feel very welcome in her beautiful home.  We had a really nice bedroom with a private bathroom across the hall. Her two cats are gorgeous, by the way.  She left for work the next morning and we locked the door behind us when we left.  That's a lot of trust and you have to respect her for that.  It was an awesome experience.  It was like visiting family."
2894591,50999585,2015-10-16,43449494,Catherine,"My stay with Sue was my first Airbnb experience, and she is an excellent brand ambassador for newbies! Everything went exactly as expected, she was quick to get respond to questions, her home was easy to find, the accommodations were great (super comfy bed!) and Sue was a gracious hostess. Highly recommended!"
2894591,51172190,2015-10-18,23398723,Shelby,"This is my second stay with Sue! It is so beautiful in her area of Salem right now, with all the fall colors. Another very comfortable stay in her beautiful home. Sue so attentive to anything a guest might need. I was there once again for soccer ; so was not around much !  Sue respected that I just needed a good nights sleep, and that delicious  chocolate :-)"
2894591,52098522,2015-10-26,43826452,Kc,"From the moment I booked with Sue I knew we'd have a great stay. I noticed several interests we have in common on her profile - namely favorite sports - and we had a nice exchange via email before arriving. Once there we were made to feel so at home. Sue is a great hostess, easy going and she clearly enjoys her role as an Airbnb host. We loved the comfy bed, the spotless bathroom, and the local bakery goodies she treated us to in the morning, not to mention the fresh berries, coffee, tea and OJ. We greatly appreciated having breakfast at Sue's so we could get on with our busy days in Salem while visiting our son at nearby Willamette University. The real bonus at Sue's is what I called her forest wonderland right outside her numerous windows. All sorts of forest creatures are also treated to Sue's hospitality, so while we sat at her dining room table we were delighted to watch squirrels and birds galore darting about to the many feeders placed in her woodsy backyard. Her two cats joined us in marveling at the intimate display of nature right in front of us. Truly special. The house is at the end of a cul-de-sac in a very pretty residential section of Salem that is an easy drive to and from downtown. We look forward to returning to Sue's on another trip to Salem. "
2894591,53869493,2015-11-13,47940964,Laura,"Sue was very accommodating, the only concern was the last day when she had things to do , i felt a little pressured to leave  early.. Otherwise wonderful host!"
2894591,55026198,2015-11-27,17569226,Jill,We stayed with Sue Thanksgiving night while we were visiting family in Salem.
2894591,56358637,2015-12-12,51038065,Fred,"Sue made us feel very welcome, the description was very accurate and her home is located in a very nice neighborhood.
We loved watching the birds outside her dining room window
while having coffee in the morning. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate with a great shower.
The house was very clean. 
It is apparent that Sue takes being a host very seriously.
We would stay with her again.

"
2894591,56729778,2015-12-17,266880,Cyndy,Sue is a lovely host.  She made me feel very welcome in her home.  The house is in a gorgeous wooded setting and very peaceful.  The bed is comfortable and I slept great.   The location is a short drive to my Salem office and close to amenities like Ventis pub and downtown Salem.  
2894591,57002151,2015-12-20,12932464,Sherry And Terry,"Sue replied to our contact w/ her very quickly! That means a lot when on a road trip. Her home and guest accommodations are a combo of very enjoyable eclectic art and the warmth of her love for family. Fresh, spacious, clean and comfortable in every way. Sue takes great care to make sure everything is just right for her guests! "
2894591,57107487,2015-12-21,10351275,Joe,Sue was a great host and her accommodations were perfect for us.  We are Airbnb host as well so it was nice to compare notes and chat about our similarities and differences.  Sue's home is warm and cozy and beautifully appointed.   The bed was dreamy.  We will definitely keep this spot in mind for our next trip to Salem.  
2894591,60028123,2016-01-18,27781956,Kelly,"Sue is amazing; very genuine and giving! I loved staying at her place. Awesome bed, cozy home, and good coffee :) I thoroughly enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place in the Salem area! "
2894591,71851945,2016-04-29,49794797,Elizabeth,"Sue was a gracious host and the room was very comfortable.  I stayed with Sue for 3 months on an extended work assignment. I worked long days and left on the weekends. Sue was respectful of my schedule and allowed me space if I was tired and didn't want to talk, but always available for some company (though not intrusive).  Coffee was ready every morning before I went to work and we shared several evening meals together. She offered to have a little breakfast for me (bagel, muffin, etc.) but I had my own, so she had fruit for me to take to work.  Sue has two friendly cats who are willing to cuddle after they get acquainted, but Sue was respectful that not everyone wants a cat on their bed and tried to keep Cricket, the cat, out of my room (but I kept letting her in). Everything in the house was very clean and tidy. The room has a bed, dresser and closet space. The bathroom is right across the hall. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. I really enjoyed getting to know Sue and having a comfortable space to rest my head after work. "
2894591,72474452,2016-05-02,29120906,Neil,"Sue did a good job making us feel welcome and at home.  Her spot-less  home and yard are  delightful.    The contentental  breakfast was served with a full view of her nicely landscaped yard.   The bed was extremly cozy and comfortable.  The home is located on a cul-de sac on a wooded hillside.   Sue was good for conversation, but left plenty of time for private moments."
2894591,76482302,2016-05-27,7882877,David,"Lovely place, was able to accommodate us driving down late from Portland. Squirrels and wildlife in the back yard. Note they have cats inside if you're allergic."
2894591,78171681,2016-06-05,66657884,Roy,"Sue greeted us at the door and opened her home to us.  Her home is clean and neat and located in a quiet suburb of Salem, Oregon but an easy drive to all conveniences.  We had a clean and neat 3/4 bath (shower, no tub) all to ourselves.  The bathroom was fully stocked with towels and other essentials.  We had plenty of hot running water to soothe our aching muscles after a lot of driving.  Sue provided coffee in the mornings and offered light breakfast fare."
2894591,78830962,2016-06-09,65285072,Jenny,Sue was an incredibly warm and inviting woman. She has truffles waiting bedside for you when you arrive as well as handmade soap to use. We really enjoyed her playful cats as well as the decor (much of which is handmade by her father!). Highly recommended stay.
2894591,79466098,2016-06-12,70009994,Carol,"I stayed at this Airbnb whilst taking a 3-day art class in Salem. My room and separate bathroom were clean, comfortable and offered privacy. The bed was wonderful and I slept well. The neighborhood was charming and very quiet. At my request, Sue was willing to place an armchair in the room for sitting and reading. She provided yogurt and fresh fruit for breakfast. The house is charmingly decorated and really cozy and I appreciated it not being overheated. The view from dining area to back garden is delightful, with many hanging squirrel and bird feeders and lots of active critters running around.
I found Sue to be an excellent host and entertaining conversationalist, with interesting stories of her times spent living in other countries.
If I ever go to Salem again and need accommodation, I would certainly enjoy returning to Sue's cozy home.
"
2894591,79695595,2016-06-13,214907,Christine,Sue welcomed us into her tranquil space and natural habitat for critter viewing. Meticulous bedroom with bath just across hall. Very gracious host. Lovely rest after long ride.
2894591,80156448,2016-06-16,18850382,David,"Excellent stay! Was just in town for one evening prior to some job interviews, and Sue not only provided a peaceful place to stay the night, but offered extremely helpful advice re: navigating downtown Salem's sometimes counter-intuitive parking scheme. The pot of coffee and light breakfast Sue put out in the morning were unexpected (but most welcome) treats.
Plus, Sue's two cats are delightful."

2894591,82650930,2016-06-28,69284370,Emily,My stay with Sue was as if I had come to visit a friend I'd known for years. Sue combines professional efficiency and amazing cleanliness with a relaxed and considerate friendliness. I enjoyed watching TV with her in the evening but I also had freedom to simply sit out on her deck in the early morning with coffee she had ready by 6:10. She also had a nice array of fruit and breakfast breads all laid out for me so all I had to do was  enjoy the quiet time I always need in the morning.  My night's sleep was on a perfect bed in a perfectly quiet and woodsy neighborhood.
2894591,83141411,2016-07-01,79439955,Lisa,"Sue is an incredible host. She was welcoming, warm & friendly. The room & the rest of the house was clean, provide all I had expected and more. Sue goes above & beyond to help guests feel pampered."

We were always filled in about details (keys, food, etc) and felt very welcome to make ourselves at home. Her home is open and spacious with a great view of the woods and lots of entertaining birds and squirrels to observe. The bed was very comfortable and we both slept well every night of our 5 night stay. "
2894591,85390595,2016-07-11,5230075,Dushyant,"Great place. Got my own bathroom. Very quiet. Sue was a great host.

2894591,88860265,2016-07-25,3240938,Sonia,"Sue was a great host.  She was friendly, welcoming, and very accommodating of our specific traveling needs.  She was flexible with arrival time and took a lot of care to make us feel at home.  For example, we needed to make some last-minute arts and crafts project for our friends' wedding, and she was able to help us find a location and some supplies in her house to work on the project.  Our plans were also in flux and she was able to work around that.  Highly recommend.  "
2894591,90242209,2016-07-31,53982041,Nihal,"Sue was a great host and very nice person. She made us feel welcome. We were able to chat briefly. She had good suggestions for our visit to the ocean side of Oregon. The house was very clean and quite well decorated. We had a private bathroom. The neighborhood was residential and quite. It was great for rest and relaxation. She offered us breakfast, but we had to leave early. Overall, it was a great experience. "
2894591,92177925,2016-08-07,32074463,Anne,"Sue welcomed me when I arrived and explained everything I needed to know as her guest.  Her home is immaculate and nicely decorated, in a very nice, well-located neighborhood.  The bedroom is lovely and the bed itself is very comfortable.  The bathroom is directly across the hall, with a nice glass shower.  Sue made me feel right at home.  She is a gracious host and I enjoyed chatting over a few meals with her during my week's stay.  Sue's cats, Cricket and Mr. Big are beautiful and it was nice looking out over her wooded back yard with the birds and squirrels Sue feeds.  I appreciated her generosity, including the good info she had to share about the area.  There are good reasons for Sue's many great reviews!

"
2894591,92544679,2016-08-09,32074463,Anne,"Sue welcomed me personally on my arrival and I quickly felt at home and at ease.  The neighborhood is quiet, pleasant and has convenient access to River Rd. S.  Sue's comfortable, nicely decorated home has large
windows that overlook a wooded area with bird (and squirrel!) feeders.  I enjoyed having breakfast and watching the critters, including Sue's beautiful cats, Cricket & Mr. Big. My room and bath (with lovely shower)
were spotless and tasteful.  Sue keeps a very clean, tidy house and takes care that guests' needs are well met.  Communication with Sue was fine, both before and during my stay.  She is a gracious host, whose company I thoroughly enjoyed - she tells a good story and is quick to laugh.  Sue is generous with her knowledge of the area, which I appreciated  as a newcomer to Salem.

2894591,97030665,2016-08-25,50302576,Rud,"My girlfriend and I stopped here on a road trip. Sue was extremely accommodating with our difficult schedule, which relieved a lot of anxiety. She even left us coffee and breakfast in the morning! When we arrived the place was beautiful and immaculately clean. The neighborhood feels like it's tucked away in a deep forest, despite being just a short drive from downtown. We did not get to interact much with Sue, but her adorable cat was a great ambassador! "
2894591,98139480,2016-08-29,29765753,Sally,"
This was my second stay at Sue's cozy home and it was every bit as enjoyable as the first visit. The bed is very comfortable, the room is quiet, and the house is spotlessly clean. I again loved watching the wildlife out the of the picture windows and enjoyed the resident cats, Cricket and Mr. Big. Sue is a seasoned host, is easy going and great fun to visit with, but also respects privacy. Delicious coffee and scones for breakfast. "

She was kind, welcoming and made it very easy for me to adjust. I would love to stay with her again. She is definitely a super host! Thanks again to Cricket and Mr. Big. The cutes cats in the world.

2894591,104981070,2016-09-29,16023829,Migs,"Sue is a most pleasant host.  She keeps her cozy home impeccably neat and clean.  The neighborhood is quiet and conveniently located- less than 10 minutes from downtown Salem, yet a world away.  Just a mile away from Salem Golf Club, after playing golf there and dining at Rudy's, it was perfect after a couple of days of work."
2894591,105159294,2016-09-30,78130132,Matthew,I had a quick overnight trip in Salem and this place worked out nicely. Sue was very communicative throughout my trip and made coordinating my stay easy. The bed was comfortable (a little on the softer side) and clean.

The bed was very comfortable with a thick mattress pad that eased their aches and pains after full days of sightseeing. They appreciated the very clean private bathroom. Sue was flexible with our schedule. She provided coffee and breakfast, including fresh fruit, cereal, and delicious homemade blueberry cake. The big, bright windows provided a great view of the birds, squirrels, and deer who were drawn to her feeders. Sue is a fascinating host who enjoys sharing her many interests with her guests. I highly recommend staying here!"

I think it would be better for a shorter visit than a longer visit. I was comfortable, but there was not enough space to store my clothes and other items, so much remained in my car or on floor of the bedroom or in my suitcases. 
Sue was helpful with info on Salem (map, visitor guide, newspaper)
Sue also shared homemade soup with me several times, which was lovely. 
I enjoyed watching birds and squirrels out the giant picture windows.

The room was clean, cute, and comfortable. Sue was a great host, and we enjoyed our conversations with her. She was even able to recommend a pizza place in the area with games and an arcade so our son could have a little fun. It was a great first Airbnb experience. If we are ever back in the area and need a place to stay this would be it. "

Her place was super clean and quiet, and the bed was comfortable. She even had an amazing local chocolate truffle and bottle of water by the bed side!

Her home is lovely, and easy to get to - but is in a quiet neighborhood in the woods that makes you feel like you're far from town. The room and bathroom are really nice, and Sue goes out of her way to provide little details throughout the stay to make you feel at home and welcome - plus a great spread at breakfast that was awesome and is so rare on AirBnB these days, despite being a staple once upon a time! Sue was also great - we were in town for wedding, so the day we stayed with her, we missed her on check in, but then were out late (for us! 10:30pm) with the rest of the wedding party. Sue stayed up to check with us that we had everything and welcome us - it was so nice! Thank you so much Sue, we highly recommend your place!"

Nestled in between trees, you can see a lot of squireels5and birds outside. The home was spotless and the restrooms looked as if they were just installed, clean with fr e st towels.

2894591,168068049,2017-07-08,100099138,Jane,"Sue was a nice host. We enjoyed her home and the location in Salem. Her home is in a very quiet and private area of town.   We enjoyed fresh coffee every morning while watching wildlife through her large windows in her dining area. Our bathroom and bedroom was super clean. We will stay again if we are in the area.  
Thank you, Sue!"
2894591,169227687,2017-07-11,105651543,Shelsee,"Sue accepted our booking with very little notice after plans fell apart somewhere else. She was gracious, welcoming and a delight to visit with. Her home is immaculately kept, adorable and the yard/surroundings were unbeatable. We loved watching all the forest creatures come right up to her huge windows. The neighborhood was surprisingly quiet for being so close to downtown. I have a disabled son and she had lots of good suggestions on finding him good care after our move to Oregon from Utah. 11/10 stay.

My only advice to future travelers is don't wait to book if she has an opening. "

We wish Airbnb had an ""in home pets"" field for the companions some home owners have on hand.  This home had two friendly cats, but if your not a cat fan, at least you know now."
2894591,199385208,2017-10-01,9346370,Kevin,"Sue's place is the traditional airbnb - a private room in her house. With it's own bathroom right across the hall, Sue provides everything you need. I sat with her and talked for quite awhile, watched NASCAR and college football with her. If I wanted to be by myself, my private room was right down the hall. Also, felt free, and comfortable, to use the kitchen in the morning. a VERY quiet sleep!"

We watched wildlife from the large windows over our morning coffee and enjoyed hilarious antics of her cats, which have totally abandoned chasing squirrels who boldly dine within inches of them, or engage them in stare-downs through the glass door! We would come again."
2894591,201675651,2017-10-08,115735736,Susan,"Sue's house is impeccably clean.  The neighborhood is convenient to downtown Salem and Willamette University but just far enough away to be calm and peaceful. Sue is a warm, welcoming host."

2894591,210926594,2017-11-11,157277355,Ariel,"This is an awesome Airbnb. The house is easy to find, and very close to downtown Salem. As soon as I walked in the door, I could see hummingbirds and a deer in the backyard! The house is beautifully decorated with many unique art pieces, and very clean, with a peaceful, serene character. Also, the bed is great—I slept deeply. Sue, the host, is fantastic: she is kind, welcoming, and abound with suggestions for things to do in and around Salem. She even prepared breakfast in the morning! And her cats are cuddly and friendly! This was my first time using Airbnb; what a wonderful introduction to the experience. If you’re coming to Salem, stay here!"

2894591,234427526,2018-02-12,46506766,Jill,Sue was very accommodating with all my stuff since I was moving to the area.   Home is in quiet residential area. She made some wonderful dishes that she shared with me and had oatmeal available for my breakfasts (my usual). We had some excellent conversations while watching TV in the evenings.  She gave great suggestions of things to see in the area. WiFi was excellent as I used it a lot. House was immaculate. Her two cats were around and fun to watch but stayed out of my room and I never noticed any smell in house or fur on my clothes.  Perfect beginning to my time in Salem and the best AirBnB stays I have had.
2894591,239200204,2018-02-28,172873917,Christine,Sue is a great host and has a lovely home with two great cats. I had never used Airbnb before and Sue’s home was my first choice. It was certainly more than what I expected. Great experience!

She allowed us to use her kitchen as if it were our own and made sure we had fresh linens and towels each week, or sooner if we requested! Sue gave great local recommendations and provided the cutest little touches to our stay! We had a lovely stay. :)"

I enjoyed our conversations and Sue made me feel at home, which is so nice as I just moved to Salem. Also, added bonus, hanging out with her adorable kitties, Cricket and Mr. Big."
2894591,348421426,2018-11-13,14338339,Eileen,"I loved my stay at Sue's and wish that I had booked her place for all three of my nights in Salem instead of just one. Her home is lovely, the bed comfy, and I enjoyed our conversation."

2894591,452704696,2019-05-13,67791530,Bruce,"Sue keeps a sparkling clean home that welcomes you in every way.  Over the years, I have stayed in six Airbnbs in Salem on visits to Willamette University.  I've enjoyed all of them, but Sue's was the best.  I really enjoyed the sense of seclusion of her home's forest setting in the back.  Sue's creature-friends, the wild birds, squirrels, and her two cats, put on a private show through her picture windows.  From the dining room table each morning, nature quietly announces itself while we enjoyed warmed pastries from the local bakery, a bowl of fresh fruit, and a hot cup of coffee.  Quite a way to start the morning.  Will return again!"
2894591,456499475,2019-05-21,67791530,Bruce,We loved Sue’s home so much that we rebooked for another stay.  See my other review.

4394073,22781388,2014-11-14,10736851,Kevin,Mike was welcoming and inviting me into his house. He offered me towels amd extra bedding if I needed. Although we didn't have time to hangout he was flexible in me coming and going which I appreciated. Mike's home is near coffee shops and stores making it an ideal location.  Thanks for accepting my stay at your place.
4394073,23308972,2014-11-28,23868679,Mark,"Mike was a real nice host, and he's an all around great guy.  This may seem a little off topic, but he did such cool thing on one of the days I was there.  Which happened to be on Thanksgiving.  He got up early, and drove up to Portland.  Mike and a few of his friends handed out breakfast burritos to people who really needed a nice warm meal.  That right there should tell you a lot about his character, and what kind of person his is.

His place is located on a quiet dead end street.  Mike put a lot of work into fixing his place up when he bought it, and it looks real nice.    

Since I was checking Salem out for a possible place to live.  Mike is very knowledgeable, and was helpful if I had any questions about the area.

Nice Place + Friendly Host = Great Experienc (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
4394073,23887645,2014-12-13,24769188,John,"Mike was extremely responsive to my inquiry and messages, and very accommodating to my schedule (I arrived at 9pm). He is very friendly and sociable, showed me around, offered amenities. He has a chihuahua that defies stereotyping as it never barked, but rather came up to me and wagged its tail and let me scratch its ears.

The bedroom is spacious, has a large window, extremely soft bed and plush pillows (I think I melted in it) and great sheets. After having driven seven hours through traffic, it was heaven.

Interesting piece, Mike has started designing his own furniture (nesting tables and coffee tables), be sure to check them out when  you arrive, they're really something else.

Since I arrived late and have to leave early, I didn't get to interact with Mike too much, but I'm very glad I chose to stay at this location.

He is also conveniently located very close to Fred Meyer, gas stations and other places if you need to load up on supplies."
4394073,25249497,2015-01-10,13935242,Collin,"Mike is a super great guy. Would highly recommend staying with him if you are in Salem. The house is nice, and he helped me with all my questions about Salem.

Unfortunately we didn't have the pleasure to meet Mike or his dog as he was going away for the night but we did meet his friendly cat.
Mike was even so kind as to offer us his massage table to use.
Wish we could have stayed a few more days.I would definatley recommend this place and would stay again.

4394073,28545500,2015-03-25,28836696,Ralph,"Mike was a totally great host. He was friendly, helpful, and kept asking if there was anything he could do or get for me. He had a chihuahua with real character who also welcomed me, and a cat with reservations.  His house is in a nice, safe neighborhood and offered everything most travelers could want including shared very nice TV, kitchen access and  great bath and shower; the private bedroom had a fabulous bed and lots of closet space.  I'm returning here next week and looking forward to it! Thanks again, Mike."
4394073,28593449,2015-03-26,29750744,Erin,"I stayed in Salem for one night to explore the city. Mike was super friendly and the location was easy, and quick, to get to from downtown. There's also a bunch of things in his neighborhood. The room is nice and I felt totally comfortable staying there. Everything I needed was provided. I would stay again if I found myself in the area."
4394073,28963392,2015-04-01,28836696,Ralph,"This was my second stay with Mike, after a similar two-day stay last week.

Mike is a remarkable, wonderful host. He gladly shares his whole house with his guests. As was the case last week, he continued asking if I had everything I needed, and tried to make sure I was comfortable. His dog (Gitzo, a chihuahua) and Sophie the cat already knew me and were comfortable with me, which was really nice as I'm an animal lover. When I was leaving, I realized I'd miss all of them.

The bedroom was great - super bed, large closet, end tables with a lamp. As many pillows and spreads as you want or need. Highly recommended!"

Mike is a gracious and friendly host, the house is spotless, and has been a great place to stay.  Apartment took several days longer than anticipated, and I've just booked an additional couple of days to stay here longer.   Definitely recommend!"
4394073,30114135,2015-04-17,15056837,Vaughan,"This reservation was an extension of my original stay with Mike - my apartment was not ready in time, and it worked out great with Mike just to continue staying at his place.  Again - Mike's a really great host, and I couldn't have been in a better place for what I needed.  I was able to do some work right at the kitchen table, and the house is super convenient to everywhere I needed to be in Salem.  Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Salem!"

4394073,621557458,2020-04-01,81180394,Valarie,"Good location downtown, quiet cul-de-sac, beautiful home."
4785215,25070781,2015-01-05,15158992,Allyson,"Jean was delightful to work with! She made it extremely easy for us to make arrangements and let ourselves in. Her home is warm and welcoming, and our bedroom was cheerful and bright. She cooked a FABULOUS meal for us in the morning, and was very flexible about timing. I felt well taken care of and would absolutely stay there again when I am next in Salem."
4785215,26420225,2015-02-12,3389665,Kris,"Jean, my host, was thorough and prompt in responding to all of my questions prior to arriving, and absolutely welcoming when I showed up. The house was incredibly comfortable. The mattress on the bed couldn't have been better, the room had every amenity I wanted, and the bathroom shower was a pleasure. The house is an easy walk to downtown Salem. Great experience!"
4785215,27583255,2015-03-08,20987024,Andrea,"I had a wonderful time with Jean. She is welcoming, very friendly and very accommodating. She had coffee ready every morning and made 2 little blueberry muffins from scratch when I arrived, they were delicious!  The house was quaint and inviting and my room was big with a very comfortable bed and a nice view of the backyard. The second floor also has its own small kitchen with a fridge, sink, microwave and hot plate, allowing me to buy food to eat at home. Jean really made me feel at home in her house and, at the same time, was very respectful of my privacy. The house is about 5 blocks from the state capitol and 7 from downtown Salem. It is very close to the Word of Mouth Cafe. Jean loves to ride bikes and invited me to go out on my last day. It was a wonderful goodbye to Salem. When I come back, I'm staying with her!"
4785215,28196905,2015-03-19,3400541,Edward,"Wonderful room, location and host. A perfect and charming space in the middle of Salem. 
The room and entire home is tastefully decorated in a modern BnB style. The location is a short walk on lovely streets to Willamet University, Government Center and downtown Salem. Jean quickly responded to all questions always offering more help.

Great place to stay in Salem

4785215,29192184,2015-04-05,3272707,Ira,Great little b&b. Jean is very friendly.
4785215,29688520,2015-04-11,9851004,Vicki,"A lovely and comfortable historic home. Jean was very accommodating to my odd schedule and was easy to reach and responsive to our needs. The upstairs room had beautiful morning light and even though the home is located on a fairly busy street it was quiet enough to enjoy sleeping in for a change. Comfortable bed, good shower, very convenient to downtown. The start to a great weekend away.  "
4785215,34062898,2015-06-04,11241856,Joshua,"Jean was an excellent and hospitable host.  She wasn't in town at the time of my check in but provided easy instructions on how to check in.  Everything a guest would need was in the room upon check in. I stayed in the Pine Room of Century House which was spacious, clean, and had its own bathroom, microwave, and clawfoot tub.  This is perfect for a quiet retreat to work or relax in the heart of Salem. The bed was comfortable and linens fresh.  Breakfast consisted of a perfectly prepared smoked salmon and cream cheese omelet, sweet potato home fries, fruit, bread, juice, and coffee.  Bon appetite! Jean was a friendly, helpful, and caring host who was very easy to talk to and have a laugh with.  I highly recommend Century House to anyone staying in Salem!"
4785215,34996005,2015-06-14,13469984,Sara,"I had simply a marvelous time! Jean was warm and welcoming and a great cook to boot! If I'm ever in need of a place to stay in Salem, I'm definitely coming back here!"
4785215,36100482,2015-06-25,2797318,Ralph,Jean was a great host. She was very attentive to our needs and did her best to make us feel at home. She even upgraded our room and did  so without asking for more  money. 
4785215,36860842,2015-07-02,11272010,Meredith,"You couldn't ask for a better hostess than Jean. She exudes warmth and hospitality, from the plate of homemade chocolates she presented when we arrived, to coffee refills up to the moment we left. Her house is beautiful and spacious but feels very cozy at the same time. It's also in the historic district of Salem, so walking downtown to dinner was a great tour of the neighborhood. Both my dad and I agreed we would stay with Jean again in an instant, since it felt like we'd been friends for much longer than the 24hrs we visited. "
4785215,39044021,2015-07-20,13259233,Chris & Danielle,"Lovely stay: breakfast was fabulous, generous spaces to play and be, a perfect place for children and families, singles or couples.  Bedroom was comfortable and relaxing, with all kinds of little details... Plush robes, fresh flowers, water cups, books, toiletries.  
Outside spaces were particularly welcoming, including a beautiful playhouse and swing that our daughter enjoyed.  Jean is a born host."
4785215,39176217,2015-07-21,34873934,Joyce,We were welcomed as we came in the gate.  We sat and chatted  in the beautiful garden and felt very comfortable.
4785215,41585678,2015-08-08,27812401,Katharin,Jean is just the best host!  It's like visiting a close friend. Food is out of this world. She upgraded our room as it was available. And loved Salem too. 
4785215,41911070,2015-08-09,7359325,Cassandra,"Jean made us feel very welcome and her place is wonderful.  The house is cute,  clean,  and comfortable and the yard and little back house are great for hanging out.  Jeans breakfast was amazing as was her company and the company of the other guests at breakfast.  Just the right amount privacy and community.  "
4785215,43642383,2015-08-21,7616309,Dorrit,"This house is loaded with old-world charm, and Jean is a warm and welcoming host.  The rooms are comfortable, and for an extra $10 Jean serves up an amazing breakfast.  I hope I have a chance to stay here again!"
4785215,45043630,2015-08-30,42731806,Jeremy,"We arrived around 9:30 at night. Jean was not home, but had left clear and friendly instructions on how to get into the house. There was a note from Jean and two yummy brownies welcoming us on entry. The room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the sheets very soft! The bathroom was clean and was well stocked. We had a very nice, quiet and comfortable stay. The house is very conveniently located to Willamette University. Unfortunately, since Jean was not home, we did not get to experience one of her breakfasts. We did meet her in the morning and she was very friendly and I hope to be able to stay at her house again. Thanks, Jean!
"
4785215,45511002,2015-09-03,40236202,Carl,"There was a slight mix up with the reservation (no one's fault) so we ended up with an upgraded room over what we reserved so we can't be completely factual in our assessment of the actual Airbnb room. That said, I can't imagine that anyone could find fault with whatever room is offered by Jean. We had a great stay and Jean is a warm host. Easy to find even in the confusing streets of Salem. Thanks for the room! "
4785215,61410900,2016-02-03,5938331,Leonard,"I really enjoyed my stay at Century House, a true Bed & Breakfast that lived up to its bike friendly reputation. My room and the private bath were delightful. I chose the green smoothie for my included breakfast snack and it was delicious. Jean was preparing a full breakfast for other guests and it smelled wonderful. Jean arranged for a secure place to keep my bike the next day until 4pm and I was able to easily bike 6 blocks to the Amtrak station for my 5pm train. Thanks very much Jean!!"
4785215,61728844,2016-02-07,6203825,Barbara,Jean was waiting for us when we arrived.  She showed us the house and let us choose our bedroom.  
4785215,63602061,2016-02-24,2874013,Rosalyn,Jean is a great host! She made me feel like a welcome guest with the perfect combination of friendliness and attention without being at all intrusive. Her home is lovely. The accommodation could not have been better. The room was comfortable with all the little extras and conveniences. The bathroom was well supplied. Everything was immaculately clean. The off street parking was a plus and the location very convenient. I will certainly choose to stay at Jean's next time I am in Salem!
4785215,63750946,2016-02-26,3342366,Diana,"Jean is wonderful. Great hosting, delicious food, had a chance to learn about bicycling the area, and more. The accommodations were super comfortable and the location was perfect - near the Capitol, train station and restaurants, all while being in a lovely residential neighborhood. I'll be back. "
4785215,67961747,2016-04-01,5726193,Melanie,"Jean was a kind, welcoming and helpful host before and during my brief visit.  She was very responsive in previsit communications and shared local tips and stories during the visit.  Her B&B is immaculate and beautifully decorated in an old-timey way with many wonderful old quilts and books everywhere.  Her complimentary snacks were so yummy, I have no doubt her cooked breakfasts will be as well.  I'll definitely try Jean first next time I'm in the area!"
4785215,70492057,2016-04-18,43826452,Kc,"This was my third stay with Jean at Century House and it really feels like my Salem home. The house is charming and cozy, everything is impeccable and clean and Jean is so hospitable. But best of all are the breakfasts Jean prepares in the morning for her guests. And on this trip she even packed a lunch with extra healthy snacks and smoothie for my long drive home to southern California. (Jean's smoothies are the best!) With my son graduating from nearby Willamette University our trips to Salem will probably come to an end, for awhile at least, and I will very much miss having that excuse to check in to Century House and visit Jean year after year. But when I do return to Salem, it will be to Century House for sure."
4785215,74322979,2016-05-14,24093517,Michael,"Jean, we loved staying with you! We'll definitely try to stay at your lovely place the next time we're in Salem."
4785215,75544065,2016-05-22,24164879,Laurel,"Jean greeted me upon my arrival and showed me around her home. She let me choose which room I preferred on the 2nd floor and left me to get comfortable. I was very busy during my short time there and wasn't in the listing much but whenever I was Jean was a treat to talk to and her home was quiet and cozy. Her breakfast was amazing as well and I enjoyed the company while I ate. I rarely make it out to Salem but will be making an attempt to do so to experience this lovely listing again. Hands down best host I've ever met!

Thanks Jean!"
4785215,78918391,2016-06-10,75750390,Bob,"Our host Jean was very friendly. She was there to welcome us and show us around. She recommended a place to eat nearby called The Wild Pear, which was a treat. I found myself wandering into the kitchen while Jean made an egg/spinach/cheese omelette for me as she was so friendly and easy to talk with. I got to know a little about her passion for bicycling. We only stayed one night and did not see much of the town so I can't comment about the area. "
4785215,80663956,2016-06-19,70412265,Lisa,"My stay at Century House couldn't have been better!  Jean upgraded my room for free because there was a timing conflict with the room I had originally reserved. My flight into Portland arrived at night, which meant that I didn't get to Salem until almost mid-night.  Jean was kind enough to go outside and wait for me to make sure I could find the place.  The room I stayed in was immaculate - Jean even left a small bowl of fresh cherries to welcome me!  I particularly appreciated the ""instructions"" sheet that was in my room so that I had a good understanding of how things worked (i.e., how to get in and out of the house, breakfast, wifi, etc.) Jean's breakfasts were super delicious and made with local ingredients.  And last, but not least, just getting to know Jean and the other guests over breakfast was a true delight. "
4785215,82462879,2016-06-27,25167784,Jessica,"I needed a place to stay in Salem for a work function and when I arrived at Century House, I felt immediately at home.  Every comfort was exactly as I'd imagined and there were a few fun surprised too!  A Piano!  A basket of instruments!  An obvious love for bicycling!  I will surely return!"
4785215,83630819,2016-07-03,3867866,Maren,"Jean has a beautiful, comfortable house & is a very gracious host. We had a wonderful time chatting over the excellent breakfast with her and the other guests. The room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. 
Our only regret is that we were only staying one night, we would have loved to enjoy the garden & peacefulness of the house a little bit more. 
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when the opportunity arises."
4785215,84292660,2016-07-06,30257402,Jeff,Jean is such a nice host and allows us to see more of her art work. The decoration of the house is one of the best I've seen in any Airbnb home. We will definitely back again if in the neighborhood. 
4785215,85114908,2016-07-10,17296499,Christine,Really nice house within walking distance of the capitol.  Yummy breakfasts and cookies.  Jean was very helpful and responsive.  Would stay here again!
4785215,86390586,2016-07-16,2995642,James And Seong,"We loved it here. Jean is the best. We are bikers and she had just bought a new touring bike so we had lots to talk about. It's comfortable, homey, can walk to the hospital in less than 15 minutes, and town, less than 20. Secure bike storage, pump, etc. There is a little bit of road noise but not enough to bother us and we have already booked a second stay. Recommended. "
4785215,91977625,2016-08-07,85391454,Katherine,"I just loved the location and ambiance of Century House. I was able to walk to  my sister's location as well as downtown through classic historic neighborhoods. The house is charmingly decorated to compliment the Victorian styling. Jean is very welcoming and flexible. She is a wonderful cook, I am so glad I sampled her breakfasts, they we're fresh and hearty, excellent coffee. I loved my room on the second floor with my own bath. She has a lovely back yard with a swing! Beautiful trees! I will definitely stay here again when I visit Salem in the future."
4785215,93456148,2016-08-12,64325156,Mia,"Jean was sweet and gracious, the house is immaculate and beautiful, everything at your fingertips everything you could need is there."
4785215,96010142,2016-08-21,90452771,Frank,"Just amazing service all around, best first experience on Air BNB"
4785215,96377430,2016-08-22,11372269,Ciara,"A beautiful place with a wonderful host! Jean was so kind and helpful. The place felt clean, calm and inviting. I felt right at home. Jean went out of her way to accommodate my dairy allergy, making me a delicious milk free breakfast, even making fresh almond milk for my morning tea! This place is a beautifully decorated and serene haven and I highly recommend it. "
4785215,97456785,2016-08-27,3837984,Noelle,Jean's house is a little bit of heaven on earth. Plenty of parking when we drove up. She came out and greeted us and then offered us fresh baked cookies. We got upgraded in rooms in order to help out with other guests. No problem. We loved visiting with Jean and the other guests in the lovely dining room/parlor. Our room had all the little extras.  Jean had thought of everything. We felt very looked after and pampered. Hope to be back when we visit our daughter at college. 
4785215,98405400,2016-08-30,32543447,Mark,Warm and inviting accommodations. Spent a pleasant afternoon reading in the garden. Peaceful.
4785215,99466104,2016-09-04,12883715,Mariah,"Our stay with Jean went above and beyond anything we expected, even with her numerous rave reviews. 
I was nervous using AB&B as I never had before, and was traveling with my boyfriend and our four month old daughter. Jean was more than happy to accommodate our little girl, and even offered a pack and play for our use if we needed it. 
She was extremely understanding about our check-in delays due to traffic, and was always around to lend a helping hand with coffee or tea. 
We decided to pay for her breakfast option, and she did not disappoint! Her meals were delicious and just the right amount of food. She even sat with us the second morning before we left and talked, which we absolutely loved. 
I have a million more amazing things to say, but I'll stop here and just say that Jean is fantastic, and if you find yourself needing a place to stay in Salem, you should pick The Century House. "
4785215,102622791,2016-09-18,2995642,James And Seong,Always great!
4785215,109973263,2016-10-23,92842188,Darian,"Jean is the best! This was my first time renting a room through airbnb and it was such a great experience. Being in college gets hard being homesick and all, I felt right at home. The ultimate comfort zone :) sad that it ended , but will try to come back in the future"
4785215,113788334,2016-11-13,78162172,William,"Jean provides a gracious, considerate stay in her unique BnB. Her home provides a comfortable stay with healthy meals and warm conversations. She greets you with an infectious smile. "
4785215,115563805,2016-11-25,36898591,Rian & Laine,"Jean was a great hostess for our visiting family!  The B&B is cute and in a good neighborhood, within walking distance to our apartment and downtown.  "
4785215,115709009,2016-11-26,78335117,Hadley,"My mom and I spent the night at Jean's beautiful historic home and had a wonderful stay. We were just there for one night, but Jean was a very welcoming host and really made our stay special down to the little details! The room was lovely with a comfortable bed and lots of fun quilts to choose from. It was also really neat to hear about all the projects done to restore this house and a little bit of history... it really shows and is a lovely place! Would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
4785215,122736641,2016-12-25,49656966,Deborah,"Large, clean room with comfortable bed, private bath, separate entrance but close to dining/living area. Numerous amenities including robes, slippers, soaps, lotions, microwave, minifridge, and ample storage. Jean respected our privacy while making herself available if needed. We would not hesitate to stay here again."
4785215,129962691,2017-02-03,113878020,Michelle,"Both Jean and her home are warm and welcoming. I was able to enjoy a lively conversation with Jean before relaxing in a cozy bed with a good book.  The area is quiet and an easy walk to Willamette Law School.  I had everything I needed and would absolutely return when next in Salem on business,"
4785215,137843429,2017-03-17,109283086,Carol,Jean's place is very warm and welcoming. My room had a real calm & peaceful feeling to it. I slept great waking up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. Jean was great to talk to. She genuinely cared about my well being and comfort. I only wished I could have stayed longer to enjoy more of Jean's hospitality. It is a place I will most definitely return to.
4785215,142124832,2017-04-06,11656344,Regina,"Jean's home is very lovely - a cozy and inspiring retreat. It was a business trip so I chose Century House because it had really good reviews and is walking distance to the capital. It was a great choice - both convenient and comfy. Great food in the neighborhood, wonderful Steel Bridge coffee delivered to the door, and a very helpful and responsive host who was easy to communicate with and obviously cares about her guests."
4785215,151064062,2017-05-10,35816643,Israel,"Jean was a wonderful host, friendly and warm, great conversations and made us feel comfortable. I didn't realize how nice the accommodation would be."
4785215,151421310,2017-05-12,127072913,Stephanie,"I believe Jean's place is the closest airbnb to Williamette and the government buildings. I walked over. What can I say, it's a great place, an actual bnb listed through airbnb. I had a great room on the first floor. It felt like I was in a rather large studio apartment with tons of privacy if I wanted it, had my own bathroom. Jean is a great host and is a cyclist so she'll have tips both on Salem in general and cycling in the area if you have some questions there."
4785215,155229127,2017-05-27,127072913,Stephanie,"Stayed here again so I obviously recommend it. This time had a great breakfast made by Jean.  Century House is a nice, safe place for a solo traveler or a couple. Always enjoy talking to Jean. Highly recommend."
4785215,156716988,2017-05-31,9060596,Tom,Jean is the most genuine kind host you will ever meet.  Be careful what you share with her. We mentioned something smelled like chocolate chip cookies ( it was something else) but that night when we returned there were fresh baked cookies in our room. We hardly ever return to a place we've stayed before because we like new discoveries but when we return to Salem we hope to stay with Jean
4785215,161382288,2017-06-17,134814895,Michael,The room was clean and comfortable and breakfast the next morning was delicious! I'll check back with Jean next time I need to stay somewhere in Salem.
4785215,162191794,2017-06-19,26778116,Ryan,Jean came to my rescue after a hotel didn't have the reservation I had booked. She was wonderful to stay with and I hope recommend going for the breakfast.
4785215,162893294,2017-06-22,2876340,Damien,"Jean is super, a great host and very professional. The place is very central and walkable to downtown venues. The back yard is a shady cute retreat with many places to sit and relax! Same indoors, very large common areas. 
"
4785215,169809632,2017-07-13,116118160,Tiffany,Jean is a wonderful host with a stunning home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
4785215,171504660,2017-07-17,2995642,James And Seong,"The host, Jean, is great, and a hoot besides. She is an avid cyclist and bike tourer, and her place is very bike friendly, with secure locked storage, floor pump, etc. We have stayed several times for work reasons and have enjoyed it every time. "
4785215,173043703,2017-07-22,116408429,Bill,Century House is a gem and the only place one should consider when in Salem.  A beautiful heritage home with an owner who personifies customer service.  All details covered including the best nights sleep ever. First class all around
4785215,175809057,2017-07-29,138842130,Mercedes,"This house is well-kept and clean, with beautiful rooms and living space. The host, Jean, truly makes the house feel warm and welcoming. The rooms are private as well as the large bathroom. I would recommend to all! "
4785215,192670534,2017-09-10,79535683,Mary,Jean was so friendly and hospitable. She made me feel so much at home in her charming house full of quilts and beautiful antiques and everything was spotlessly clean. Her recommendations for restaurants were spot on. I will definitely stay here again if I'm in Salem.
4785215,255189711,2018-04-19,11803650,Pete,"Jean is a friendly and interesting host and her home is lovely. She runs it as a b&b, with the breakfast optional. Even though we chose not to pay extra for the breakfast, she still served a small fruit and pastry plate each day."
4785215,256444885,2018-04-22,15962375,Adrienne,"Easy check in/out, no problems coming into the home after the host was asleep. Centrally located, charming, spacious home. We didn’t take advantage of it, but there’s a small kitchenette upstairs that would come in handy if you’re staying for a few days or more. Jean is a sweetheart, the complimentary breakfast was light and fresh."
4785215,277609059,2018-06-16,61475893,Star,"Though my room was the one closest to the street, the Cedar room,  I still found my space quite cozy. Any who wish to be in the more quiet part of the upstairs should seek one of the other rooms...but then you don’t get a private bathroom...Though I didn’t spend time in the back yard, it is set up well...and peaceful. Suitable for family and/or solo contemplation. Big pluses (for me) nearby were a (by chance) yard sale, breakfast at the Word of Mouth Neighborhood Bistro (as Jean was away, so no B-fast at the house)...delicious menu, inventive atmosphere, great staff (and the Ladies bathroom is a work of art...), a thrift shop right next door to the Bistro...Jean’s location is Central Salem, by my standards.  Bikers/ long walkers could come by train, close to many things...yet still tucked away! And Angela was a great commicator/host on Jean’s behalf,"
4785215,282206474,2018-06-26,15559891,Betsy,Jean is a wonderful and gracious host. Everything was spotless and her home is lovely. Breakfast was a nice surprise and the chance to chat with Jean made our stay extra special. We will definitely look for Jean again next time we are in the area!
4785215,284603968,2018-07-01,5321171,Erin,"Jean is a wonderful host, attentive and helpful in making sure I had what I needed to be comfortable during my stay. The house was very clean, and the decorating made it feel peaceful and homey inside. Having my own bathroom was very nice, and the simple amenities in my room (air conditioning, a rocking chair, large windows, wifi) were appreciated too. I enjoyed sitting in the backyard to read on a couple of beautiful June afternoons. The house was located very conveniently for what I needed while in Salem, in a residential neighborhood close to downtown and the state capitol. All told, it was lovely to stay at Century House, and this seemed to add an extra note of happiness to my trip that probably would not have been there in the same way if I had chosen to stay at a big hotel instead."
4785215,295045816,2018-07-22,14864061,Cindy & Bruce,"This was a great place to stay!  I actually booked a second night because I liked it so well, instead of moving up to Portland to stay.  Jean is a very thoughtful, helpful host.  She made sure I was comfortable and went out of her way for me.  I also think the location was good.  I found it easy to get anywhere, including walking to a place to eat.  "
4785215,304527830,2018-08-09,9940702,Aaron,Jean was delightful and I love the location so close to downtown.  Sorry I didn’t get to try the hammock. 
4785215,307121042,2018-08-13,6605560,Tina,"Jean's Century House was one of my best Airbnb experiences.  The house itself has so much character and Jean has done a fabulous restoration job.  The house was full of beautiful quilts, many of which Jean made herself.  They had such a sweet touch.  My room - Pine I think - was perfect.  Big  comfy chair, a small desk and nice bed.  Ceiling fan was much appreciated.  Kitchenette upstairs was perfect as was the sitting/eating room.  There are lots of good books and games and I loved having no TV.  Good wireless tho.  

Jean is a most delightful host with an easy smile and sparkling eyes.  I felt so very welcomed.  She engaged with me when I wanted to and left me alone the rest of the time which is just what I like.  
I can't wait to return to see Jean and her beautiful house.  "
4785215,327332906,2018-09-23,37098067,Lan,"VERY clean space. Loved the amenities in the common spaces, and the bathroom was roomy and clean. The only thing that bothered us a bit was the wooden floor in our room (it was creaky in some places) and the bed (also squeaky when getting on and off). Jean is also super sweet and accommodating, and was more than happy to set up the pack and play for our 3-month old son. Loved it!"
4785215,432357069,2019-04-03,3852263,Daniel,"Jean is an extraordinary hostess.  She goes above and beyond to make sure everything is just right.  Her house and rooms are well decorated and very clean.  I was the only guest that night so Jean gave me a choice of rooms which was very kind of her.  Since I was the only guest it also allowed me to have the bathroom on my own which was a big plus.

Jean provided a nice light breakfast for me and worked around my schedule.  I enjoyed visiting with her as well.  She is a delightful wonderful lady and I highly recommend her and her house."
4785215,470029353,2019-06-15,151162086,Sergio,"Amazing stay and super warm care from jean, everything was super clean."
4785215,486553376,2019-07-12,270279827,Carolyn,"Jean's place is quite literally everything you would imagine in a typical B&B.  A cute old home with a hundred quilts, dozens of cute little details and a sweet, interesting lady to host your stay.  Her home has been recently refurbished and it has been done very well.  We arrived exhausted and she took us straight to our room, where she'd provided a few wonderful baked goods for us.  In the morning we had coffee and a wonderful conversation as we got to know her better.  (She does provide breakfast, but she is also a block away from a great breakfast place, and we'd told her we planned to go there).  Just a really nice stay."
4785215,492958933,2019-07-21,62049510,Francisco,Jean made me feel like home. The room was charming and the communication was excellent. In the mornings I had a delicious breakfast. She spoiled me. I really recommend her place to stay.
4785215,497711147,2019-07-28,180387687,Denise,Wonderful comfy home - every room is beautifully decorated- very clean and updated! Jean great host - offered great dinner suggestions- nice amenities- we will definitely stay again if in the area!!
4785215,503352819,2019-08-05,267404953,Debra,Jean’s place was a wonderful little escape. By the time we got there we had been in the road for about 10 days. It was great to jus sit it her yard and relax. She was great company and thoroughly enjoyed visiting with her.
4785215,538540594,2019-09-29,243482636,Emily,We had a great time at Jeans place. She is so sweet- she did our laundry and left us breakfast for the following morning. Everything was super clean and charming.
4785215,546637357,2019-10-13,3453181,Amy,"Jeans BnB is a tremendous find, beautiful rooms lots of hot water, close to University and town and the best breakfast.  thank you"
4785215,562495848,2019-11-10,307752194,Megann,Jean is very sweet and hospitable!  She upgraded us to a larger room without charge.  The house is lovely.  Strongly recommend!
4785215,602764490,2020-02-07,57820866,Jeanne,"Cute, comfortable place. More of a B&B than airbnb - filled with quilts, books, artwork and hosted by a warm, knowledgeable and kind woman who bakes terrific cookies! Note to those who might care about such things: no TV (yay!) and the bathroom is a few steps down the hallway (hotel-style bathroom thoughtfully provided!)."
4785215,615332356,2020-03-07,338162175,Deana,I loved my stay at Jean’s! She goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and welcome. I can’t wait to return.
4785215,617764240,2020-03-13,29829593,Mary,"Jean offered extraordinary hospitality during our stay.  She went above and beyond to make us comfortable and provided tips for outdoor activities.  The space is lovely with access to a sitting room and small kitchenette with a refrigerator.  She offered a lovely light breakfast.  Location is in walking distance to Willamette,  the capital, a grocery store, and few restaurants.  I would highly recommend it!"
4785215,646434854,2020-08-03,285941715,Brittany,I have stayed at many airbnb’s and Jean is a pro and one of the best. Her place is clean and has Put in time to add special little touches. It was so appreciated that she brought fresh fruit to the room. She was excellent in her communication. And her home is adorable and has all the amenities that you need for a comfortable stay.
4785215,655707092,2020-08-23,361259130,Weston,"Jean is a wonderful host and I very much enjoyed staying at her place. She has a beautiful home, lovely shaded backyard, it's conveniently close to Willamette University and was sparkling clean. The extra bonus was finding out she's a follow cyclist and being able to share some cycling stories. I would for sure book another room from her the next time I need to visit Salem!"
4785215,673562203,2020-10-11,359049507,John,One of the most coziest Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. I would give it 6/5 stars if I could!
7293821,38961460,2015-07-19,2724252,Kelli,"Our stay here was absolutely perfect! Julie and Bill were exceptionally gracious hosts. The property is charming, beautiful, clean, quiet, and meticulously maintained. We decided that after our stay here that we preferred this lovely carriage house over our own home.  Bill and Julie... Adopt us please!?

The space had been recently remodled/updated and the two crucial facets of a b&b were top notch... the bed was large and oh so comfy, the shower was spacious with plenty of pressure and hot water. Equipped with everything we needed, this room was PERFECT. Bonus points for being walking distance to Bush's pasture park where we were working for the weekend.  

All in all we wouldn't change a thing. Highly reccomended!"
7293821,40875407,2015-08-02,40120251,Elizabeth,"Julie and Bill's place was my boyfriend and my first ever Air B&B experience and we loved it. The place was extremely clean and well stocked with showering items, dishes, linens and some delicious fruit, granola, and iced tea. We enjoyed the patio after dinner (we ate at the littlest roadhouse) with a bottle of wine and gorgeous wine glasses. We slept so well in such an amazingly comfortable bed. In the morning we enjoyed a walk around the park and checked out some local spots in town which Julie and Bill recommended. We will definitely recommend to friends and hope to come back for more stays! Thank you Julie and Bill for welcoming us to your home and to the state of Oregon."
7293821,41493593,2015-08-07,39395123,Emily,"From the second we arrived Julie made us feel very comfortable. Every day she made sure we had everything we needed. The room was impeccable. It was exactly how it was described. Very clean and well appointed. Julie left drinks and snacks in the refrigerator (yogurt, granola, bagels, fruit). This was our first airbnb experience and we really felt julie went above and beyond to make our stay great. If we are ever in Oregon again, we will absolutely stay with Julie. "
7293821,41710929,2015-08-08,40631899,Roberda,"What a perfect little getaway nest! The hosts were so thoughtful in the appointment of the apartment and the setting was peaceful, beautiful and convenient. A lovely way to spend a night away from home."
7293821,42228111,2015-08-11,40732110,Michael,"The place was immaculate and inviting. If I had the time I would have enjoyed a longer stay here. The hostess was very kind, worked with my schedule, and has my highest recommendation to any prospective tenants. "
7293821,43821066,2015-08-22,29765753,Sally,"This was the perfect Airbnb experience for my husband and me. This is a well-loved, recently renovated home with a wonderful, private mini apartment for rest and relaxation in a beautiful neighborhood. And our host, Julie could not have been more gracious and welcoming. Fesh tomatoes and basil from her garden were waiting for us, together with homemade muffins, scones and granola, and delicious coffee from The Archive. Did I say perfect? Thank you, Julie, and next time, we look forward to meeting Bill."
7293821,44470107,2015-08-26,8919014,Kelly,"We ended up adding an additional night to our original 4 night stay. I guess that tells how we felt about Julie and Bill's place. The studio is cozy, but nicely decorated, very clean and just a very nice relaxing place to stay. Great quiet and tree shaded neighborhood and Julie may have the most nicely landscaped house in all of Salem. Did I mention Julie's scones? - To die for. We worried about the apartment getting warm being above a garage without air conditioning on hot summer days and evenings, but it was never an issue and we never even turned on the fan. Comfortable bed. Very private, but Julie and Bill are often up for a glass of wine on the patio, if desired. This will be tops on our list next time we are in Salem."
7293821,45294067,2015-09-01,6354138,Kate,"Our stay at the Chauffeurs Room was exceptional! Julie was friendly and helpful, but also gave us our space. The room was beautiful and very clean. Breakfast goodies were provided for us, even milk for the coffee! Everything was delicious! The neighborhood was very safe and lovely. In my opinion, there's no better place to stay if you're visiting Salem. Thanks Julie!"
7293821,46341983,2015-09-09,30658943,Ryan,"Julie's listing was perfect.  As I travel the country facilitating cooking workshops, I prefer the quaintness of a place that feel like a cozy home, to mentally prepare for my work.  Julie's accomodations were perfect. From tomatoes and basil from the garden to homesee granola and zucchini muffins for breakfast, these small details accented an otherwise perfect stay. She even let me harvest some fresh herbs from her beautiful garden. It was a beautiful estate that her and her husband have meticulously renovated... an obvious passion project with thoughtful details around every corner."
7293821,47448928,2015-09-18,23345328,Sheri,"Staying in the Chauffer's room was my first time at an Airbnb listing and I am sold! I can't imagine ever staying at a hotel again. My arrival time changed by a few hours and Julie waited up for me, left a bowl of pasta in the fridge (it was delicious) and met me with a warm smile when I arrived. The room was fabulous, comfortable, and exceeded my expectations. I hope to return soon!"
7293821,47682573,2015-09-21,23606976,Diana,"Our experience with Julie was great from start to finish.  She was friendly and very responsive to our messages when booking and when figuring out arrival times.  We really felt at ease about the process and about what to expect.  She and her husband greeted us warmly when we arrived and let us know the best way to reach them if we needed anything.  The neighborhood, house, and especially the gardens are stunning!  And the room was perfect for my husband and I.  It felt comfortable and spacious - it was so well designed and decorated.  The local goodies for breakfast were delicious!  Our only regret is that we had to leave quite early to meet a friend and didn't get to thank Julie in person for a great stay!"
7293821,48365036,2015-09-25,44890432,Andrea,"Julie welcomed me to her home with a yummy glass of wine and light snacks.  The room looked exactly as detailed in the listing, and really the amenities anticipated my wants before I knew them myself. Breakfast offering was great."
7293821,49188739,2015-10-01,10952700,Meghan,"Really enjoyed my stay in the Chauffeurs room. Clean, comfortable, and welcoming setup. Also in a nice neighborhood that feels safe to walk / jog in. Hosts were lovely - I arrived late and left early and they left some thoughtful notes and a snack for me when I arrived, and a healthy breakfast in the morning. Would love to stay here again."
7293821,49822711,2015-10-06,44386144,Jacqueline,Julie and Bill were very hospitable and accommodating.  Lovely new studio apartment and a wonderful historic area of town close to everything. The muffins and other treats were  very welcome after a long day of travelling.  
7293821,49990340,2015-10-08,41103070,Katie,"The Chauffeur Room was amazing! The room was clean, beautiful, and the amenities were really nice. Loved the muffins! "
7293821,50127525,2015-10-09,8903,Jenny,"Julie met me with a glass of wine and a friendly smile after I had driven  three hours at the end of a workday to Salem.  It was much appreciated!  The room was cozy, the shower exceptionally clean and well appointed and the bed super comfortable.  I also was especially impressed with the ample amount of snacks and breakfast items available for guests. Thanks for making my very short stay in Salem enjoyable!"
7293821,50631537,2015-10-13,41152412,Melissa,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and it's hard to imagine another topping it. Julie is an absolute delight and her Chauffeurs Room is beautiful. My daughter and I stayed here for one night as part of a visit to Willamette University. The apartment is located in a charming, safe neighborhood and is convenient to all that Salem has to offer. The bed is very comfortable and the apartment is incredibly clean. I really do wish we could have stayed longer!"
7293821,51048699,2015-10-17,281872,Anna,"This property is adorable, cozy, safe, centrally located, clean, well priced, and the host is kind and genuine. The home made breakfast treats she leaves in the room upon arrival are delicious. If this room is available to book for your trip, don't hesitate -- you won't be disappointed. "
7293821,52305019,2015-10-27,42239565,Annie,"The Chauffeur's Room is a sweet, comfortable place in a wonderful neighborhood!  My daughter and I stayed just one night while on college tours but would have liked to stay longer and explore.  Everything we needed was provided, with special touches like homemade granola, cookies hot from the oven and dining recommendations.  When the Wi-Fi didn't work, Julie responded immediately and restarted it.  It still didn't work for us but that may have been from our end.  We enjoyed the cable TV instead.  Our stay in Salem was made personable and easy with these hosts. "
7293821,52702674,2015-11-01,25282673,Megan,"Julie met us when we arrived. She is very welcoming, explained the key system: all very easy. The apartment is lovely as are the gardens and the neighborhood. And Julie provided delicious homemade gluten free granola, homemade gluten free muffins, juice, coffee, tea, bottled water, and almond milk. In addition the bathroom was stocked with shower supplies, hair dryer which was lovely. Highly recommend experiencing this lovely spot.
"
7293821,53670964,2015-11-10,19989181,Gina,Julie was very nice considerate and thoughtful. The room set up was great. Everything I needed was there. 
7293821,54351078,2015-11-18,10952700,Meghan,"Julie and Bill are wonderful hosts, and I have now stayed at the Chauffeurs Room for my 3rd time while staying in Salem. Each time it has been a really warm, thoughtful experience, and they have been very inclusive and considerate. The room is lovely, clean, and in a great neighborhood in Salem. Fridge always is stocked with some great treats."
7293821,55162053,2015-11-28,49569931,Iona & Huib,"This was a delightful and cozy place for my partner and I to stay.  We were welcomed very warmly, and the apartment had everything we needed.  The apartment is very tastefully decorated, everything is of a  high quality.  In addition to all of this, the apartment is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and downtown Salem is within walking distance.  Also, this was the perfect location from which we could to explore the wonderful wines of Willamette Valley.  "
7293821,56849817,2015-12-19,47702795,Veda,"We enjoyed our stay.  The place was immaculate and inviting and our hosts were (Website hidden by Airbnb) warm, available and did all they could to make our stay fantastic."
7293821,57456597,2015-12-26,19845334,Nicole,"We stayed in Julie's Airbnb over Christmas Eve and Christmas while visiting family. Their accommodations were wonderful! Warm, comfortable and very clean. This was far better than any hotels we've stayed in in town. We'd definitely recommend them and stay here again!"
7293821,58360860,2016-01-02,6818358,Margot,Immaculate and very cozy place. Great attention to details making our stay very comfortable. Breakfast goodies were a nice surprise and much appreciated. We will be back.
7293821,60019930,2016-01-18,50991974,Bruce,"Julie has a wonderful and cute home that will make anyone feel comfortable and cozy on those rainy Salem days!  Fantastic neighborhood, and we won't stay anywhere else when in town.   "
7293821,61462625,2016-02-04,3551315,Stephen,"Julie could not have been friendlier or more accommodating (as example, she got me almond mill when I mentioned being lactose intolerant). The Chauffeur's Room is a great little apartment that has everything one might need. It is attached to a beautiful home in a very elegant and secluded neighborhood (the Governor's mansion is just down the street) yet only minutes from downtown. I will definitely stay there again."
7293821,61729088,2016-02-07,17249094,Anna,"We loved our stay in the Chauffeur's Room!  The space is adequate for two.  It has a queen bed, comfy chairs, kitchenette that if fully loaded with any essentials you may need for a few days stay.  The shower space is spacious although for the taller human specimens it may be a bit short.  The hosts were very welcoming and went above and beyond assisting us with our ventures.  We loved that we were ""on our own"" for breakfast, if you will.  Our room had a plate of muffins, yogurts, granola, orange juice, coffee, tea, bottled water, fresh fruit, yoiu name it. This allowed us to come and go at our own schedule without having to wait around for ""breakfast to be served."""
7293821,61871806,2016-02-08,15018426,Tricia,"As many others have attested, Julie is a delightful hostess - warm, welcoming, and responsive to all requests (since my stay was only for one night, I didn't get to meet Bill). Their home and garden is beautiful and well-kept in every way. Julie kindly dug around for a CD player and an alarm clock for me, as well as offering me a surprise lunch when I arrived. Her treats were yummy. The upstairs space is very private and quiet, with many thoughtful details. And the neighborhood is a wonderful place to walk, with lovely views out to Mt. Hood, and the surrounding hills and valleys. It's also close to many points of interest, but I elected to just stay put! Yep, this is another great Airbnb find! Thanks so much, Julie!"
7293821,62259093,2016-02-13,53950057,Mark,"Julie was an excellent host who greeted us on arrival and made sure we had everything we needed (including some delicious crumpets and muffins for our first morning's breakfast). The room was perfectly cozy and well-appointed, and wonderfully quiet and private. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the shower was great. And their beautiful villa property was just the right location for our family visit in Salem. We would definitely stay there again on our next visit to town."
7293821,62431094,2016-02-14,8694445,Rita,"Our hostess, Julie, was very welcoming and helpful regarding the room, the area's walking routes and antique stores. We loved the room. It was as described; maybe even better than depicted. Quaint, very clean, a comfy bed... and the homemade scones and granola were so delicious. We ate every last drop of both. Would recommend the Chauffeur's Room at the Villa and we hope to come back when it's warm out to enjoy the beautiful outdoor space! The property and the neighborhood are both beautiful and very close to everything!"
7293821,62907222,2016-02-18,14656873,Juan,"Great apartment as described.  Very peaceful.  Very clean.  Would certainly stay again.

Julie most welcoming with muffins and water bottles/milk in the unit."
7293821,63589040,2016-02-24,23143319,Kristi,"Julie was excellent with coordinating our arrival, everything was just as shown/described on the listing page, and my boyfriend and I felt very comfortable in the Chauffeurs Room.  The flannel sheets were cozy, and the bed was very comfortable!  There were cookies and muffins for us in the morning :-) Julie's home and the neighborhood in general are beautiful.  Thanks for a great stay Julie!"
7293821,63684190,2016-02-25,54597164,Christina,Everything was absolutely perfect!!!!! Great location and very private. I will absolutely stay there again! :-)
7293821,63785448,2016-02-27,50997633,Richard,"Julie has just the right personality for being a host. She made sure to be there at my expected time of arrival, made me feel like an honored guest and was exceptionally friendly. The unit is unusual, literally a former chauffeur's quarters above the garage. It's private with its own separate entrance and has everything one would need to spend a few comfortable nights. "
7293821,64288675,2016-03-02,12834577,Jill,Julie was the sweetest and most attentive host! Her home is gorgeous... Love the neighborhood. Such a nice quiet spot with all the little things taken care of. Will recommend this spot to everyone!!
7293821,65064618,2016-03-10,10177993,Megan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great welcome into the Airbnb community. The Chaffeur's  Room at the Villa was comfortable, clean (which I am truly finicky about) and adorable. It was stocked with everything I needed to make my stay run smoothly. The hosts were a joy to interact with and were very organized and considerate. I will definitely be back. -- Karri E"
7293821,65449668,2016-03-13,58927757,Elizabeth,"Julie met us when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. My daughter and I were in Salem for wedding dress shopping. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. Really enjoyed our surrounding, very quiet and serene. Julie and Bill had Breakfast items ready for us in the fridge (which is awesome) for the morning. The scones were handmade and so great! We can't say enough about our stay, it was perfect for our busy weekend. There wasn't anything that Julie and Bill forgot. They really know how to make you feel at home and yet provide a very peaceful and private retreat. Can't say enough good things about our stay. Thank you Julie and Bill!"
7293821,66257207,2016-03-20,44346844,Jamie,My husband and I enjoyed our stay very much. I wished we could have met Julie but our schedules were just off. Everything was as described and every comfortable. The neighbor was kind and curious about where we were from. It feels like a home away from home for sure. Very private. 
7293821,66646274,2016-03-23,17891763,Sally,"All my thanks, Julie and Bill, for a warm and welcome stay at your Chauffeurs Cottage.  It was just the experience I was looking for!  All the extras were truly appreciated, and I felt pampered!  I hope we will stay in touch!
Sally"
7293821,69402575,2016-04-11,33521912,Jill,"Julie and Bill are very welcoming and wonderful to interact with. And Julie is ridiculously adorable as a host. I show up to a gorgeous property and find an infectious smile and sunny disposition, am shown a very clean and tidy room looking just like the photos, and find homemade cookies and a welcome note as we thought I might arrive when they were not home. Love that. She made sure I knew she was available if I found myself in need of anything at all, then took her leave so that I could get settled in. 

I start looking around and find: a glass container of homemade granola with a banana for me to have for breakfast. Hmm...I'm going to need milk, so I look in the fridge. Yep, there's milk. Plus yogurt, bottles of water and orange juice. Julie, you rock. I don't drink coffee or tea but I notice some of that lying around too. 

Other unexpected things I found: Adult coloring books and colored pencils, travel and lifestyle books, board games, an oscillating fan, portable heater, portable stereo w/cd player, clothes drying rack... she really does have it covered, in my book.

Omg. And the bed. That delightful fluffy cloud of a bed. Bliss. Well, for me, anyway. We all have different needs when it comes to a bed.

I could go on but you're probably tired of reading at this point so I'll wrap it up with: Enjoyed my stay, was pleasantly surprised, exceeded expectations, charming hosts, would recommend to anyone, and will definitely and eagerly stay here again.  :)

Ok I lied. One more thing: the neighborhood. Filled with beautiful historic homes. Including the one you are staying at. I went for a walk to explore and you should too, its a great neighborhood. It is a bit hilly, though, so that might be a challenge/hinderance to some. A nice bit of fitness for others. I straddle the line on that one, but it was worth it.  ;)"
7293821,69533095,2016-04-11,61933595,Randy,"We had a great time.  The room and the neighborhood was beautiful with lots of mature landscape and blooming flowers.  We did not get to meet Julie until we were ready to leave, but her communication was excellent and we had no problems getting settled and were very comfortable.  When we are back in the area, we will try to stay with Julie again."
7293821,69848738,2016-04-14,66236485,Rb,"This was the most superior lodging experience I have had (and I travel for work often).  Everything about the stay was perfect and, if you enjoy beautiful architecture and stunning landscaping, you're going to love this place (the photos cannot do this place justice)."
7293821,70217610,2016-04-17,4913888,Borrego Surf Club,"The only place to stay in Salem! The neighborhood and house are goregous.  Julie, the Owner, has great taste and has made the small space very comfortable and cozy. You can tell she loves hosting, as she left my wife and I fresh baked muffins and granola for breakfast. Every last detail was thought of and we could not have been happier."
7293821,70623164,2016-04-19,29485922,Karen,"Julie was a lovely host. She made us feel very welcomed. The room and bathroom are beautifully appointed and everything you could ever need was provided including great homemade muffins. We really appreciated the good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. There was also plenty of off street parking right outside. We cannot recommend the chauffeurs room more highly."
7293821,71132308,2016-04-23,66569512,Air2016,"Perfect!  My wife and I stayed for two nights while visiting our daughter at college. Very comfortable. The room was well done with modern conveniences but retained the charming character of the house. We highly recommend it. (Oh yeah, the muffins and granola was delicious "

7293821,74927307,2016-05-17,64037107,Chad,"Julie made Sue and I feel warmly welcomed and even had fresh baked muffins out for us with homemade granola and a few other things in the fridge - this kid of attention make all the difference in a world of options. She is kind-hearted and thoughtful. We can't say enough good things about her:) 

The Chauffeurs Room at the Villa is beautiful and the grounds are stunning - it a great neighborhood to walk or stroll our newborn! Highly recommended place to come for a few days or a few weeks, as we did! "
7293821,75934865,2016-05-23,64037107,Chad,"When we arrived Julie had bottles of water out and homemade granola and muffins for us, not to mention a few goodies in the fridge. The neighborhood is beautiful, the gorgeous homes and friendly people were a big bonus for us. We had just adopted a baby girl, Aya! and were in need of lots of stroller time and the neighborhood was perfect. Julie is kind hearted and very thoughtful and willing to always go the extra mile for her guests - we felt at home at the Chauffeurs Room, and highly recommend it to anyone heading for Salem for 1 night or, as we did, 16 days! Julie is fabulous, can;t say enough good tights about her:) "
7293821,76343665,2016-05-26,9060596,Tom,Beautiful alternative to Salem hotels.  Everything you need to have a home away from home.  We will be back :)

thanks jeff and shirley"
7293821,78372728,2016-06-06,47392499,Will,"We enjoyed a wonderful visit with Julie - she is quite gracious.  The weather didn't cooperate - it reached 101 in early June - but we had a lot to do in the Salem area.  Wonderful restaurants and we rode our bikes on Minto Island - very close by.  The place was so private - surrounded by trees.  We would enjoy staying there again for sure.
"

7293821,81909413,2016-06-25,63024702,Lorin,"This is a cute, functional place on a beautiful property with a nice garden.  The hosts are so welcoming and friendly.  The neighborhood is one of the best in town, filled with older, elegant homes.  You can walk to a nice, quiet park with a playground - it's several blocks away and as mentioned, the neighborhood is really pretty."
7293821,82085986,2016-06-26,16815579,Nancy,"We were fortunate to find this little gem available for our stay in Salem. The location is in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood but only a few minutes from downtown. The hosts made us feel very welcome from the first minute we arrived. The apt was private, clean and included all necessities we could possibly require.  The shampoo and soap products were wonderful, and the bed/bedding was the best I've ever slept in! Fresh fruit, granola and Almond milk awaited us for our breakfast.  I would highly recommend this cozy studio for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing stay."
7293821,82982621,2016-06-30,53841437,Dave,"As our first AirBnB experience, it was truly great. Our hosts (Julie and Bill) were very welcoming, and the apartment was quite nicely appointed and well-suited to our needs.  It sat on top of the garage and was private from the rest of house.  Julie surprised us with a delicious treat for breakfast-- freshly picked blueberries from her garden!  "

7293821,84524853,2016-07-07,21172075,Mike,"Julie was a great host and supremely nice.  The property itself is a guest house above the garage with it's own entrance so you can come and go as you please without disturbing anyone.  The neighborhood is adorable and very quiet and pleasant.  You're about 1.5 miles from Downtown Salem so easy access is had to everything you might need.  We used Salem as a base for exploring wine country and this location served us perfectly.  I'd highly recommend staying here if you need a spot in Salem with one caveat; this space is not great for tall people.  I'm tall and had to crouch the whole time.    I'd hit my head in the stairwell, the room, the shower, and the bathroom.  So, if you're over 6'0"", you've been warned.  "
7293821,84774807,2016-07-09,7893880,Stephanie,The Chauffeurs Room was charming and had everything you would need! Julie was very friendly and accommodating! We highly recommend staying here.

It is quiet, charming, decorated with style, and perfectly maintained with everything we needed (hair dryer, shampoo and soap, coffee, refrigerator, microwave, wifi, slippers, and even an ironing board and iron--we were going to a wedding so that was handy!). The garden is gorgeous, and this is a beautiful neighborhood, just minutes from downtown by car. The owners are wonderful. Thank you for the treats!  They were perfect for the morning so we could take our time getting ready for the day. "
7293821,85900418,2016-07-13,81959439,John,"Julie and Bill were very sweet people to meet. Their house is tucked away in a historic neighborhood of Salem. Everything was very clean, neat, and well kept. The accommodations are comfortable and access to the place is easy and the environment of the inside and outside are calm and quiet, which is welcomed during business travels. "
7293821,88891914,2016-07-25,8205995,Richard Or Rose,Julie and Bill were both very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed meeting them both. The apt was very clean and very comfortable. The space was well planned and appointed. I am only sorry my wife did not get to stay this time.  Hopefully she can next year. Lovely setting with outside sitting area and Julies lovely garden. Thanks for a great stay.

7293821,89434550,2016-07-28,19418386,Lynn,"Wow!  Julie was a really great host and her house (and apartment of course) are gorgeous.  Julie went out of her way to be available and helpful. She gave us ideas about places to eat and  go for a morning run.  She also gave us lots of interesting information about the history of her home. In addition to all this, the shower in the apartment is simply the best ever.  We definitely enjoyed our stay!!

7293821,90587463,2016-08-01,19092989,Anne,"Julie's place was just perfect!  Everything you need- super comfortable bed and lovely calming space.  Her garden is beautiful.  I was really just there to sleep so did not explore Salem.  Shower pressure great, toiletries provided.  Yummy muffins for breakfast.  She was very flexible about all arrangements.  Would stay here again for sure! "
7293821,91257152,2016-08-04,85505691,Carrie,"My family and I had a fantastic stay here. The Chauffers Room was perfect for us and it even came with delicious muffins, granola, and coffee. The room is so beautiful and clean and the grounds all around their home are idyllic and relaxing. We felt so welcomed and at home. Julie gave us perfect recommdations for places to visit and things to do. We loved staying here and will definitely return again. I recommend it for anyone looking for a beautiful and relaxing place to stay with kind, warm, and welcoming hosts. "
7293821,91723587,2016-08-06,10102069,Nicholas,"Julie personally greeted us upon arrival and was most welcoming.  The Chauffer's room was comfortable and well appointed. Julie and Bill seem to have thought of everything a guest would  need, right down to slippers and homemade granola. A wonderful stay! "
7293821,92665623,2016-08-09,81905306,Blair,"Our stay was nothing short of wonderful! Julie was so welcoming from the moment I stepped on the grounds of her home. The room was so clean and had everything we could ever need (from a microwave to a fridge, extra blankets and pillows, to all bathroom necessities). I highly recommend staying here; we are actually already booked for another stay with Julie and Bill. Such a beautiful home with amazing and kind hosts!!!"
7293821,92897173,2016-08-10,81492111,Andie,"Located in an upscale, quiet neighborhood, Julie's home was a perfect stay for us in Salem. Like the cutest B&Bs, it's beautifully appointed, designed and decorated with every detail considered. We were very comfortable there and wouldn't hesitate to return!"
7293821,93551771,2016-08-13,642445,Christine,"Julie was very welcoming and helpful. The room itself, is modest in size, but totally comfortable with everything I could possibly need. And it was the prettiest room I ever stayed in too, looking like it had been put together by an interior decorator. I loved the colors, art, and high quality bedding. And there were unexpected niceties, like milk, almond milk, butter, and bottles of filtered water in the frig. Though the room was small (but not uncomfortably so) it is part of a large estate that is absolutely gorgeous. As a guest, I was invited to enjoy the grounds. This home is located on top of a hill, in a lovely, leafy, neighborhood. It was very quiet at night, and I felt very safe there. It is only a few blocks from a main street which can either take you directly downtown to a concentration of shops and restaurants or away from downtown to many other shops and restaurants in strip malls. For dinner, I ended up at a natural foods store nearby where I got a wonderful meal from the deli. The next morning I shopped downtown at Macy's, Penney's and Ross's for clothes. So even though it is a quiet residential location, it is very  it is a convenient location for dining and shopping."
7293821,94052968,2016-08-14,4965941,Barbara,Very lovely apartment with all the amenities. Our hosts were gone for the weekend but their communication was great.  There is a beautiful yard and garden for enjoying a sit down before heading out for the evening.  Very very nice neighborhood.  It was nice to have a large fan as it was quite warm this weekend.  The shower was the best!  
7293821,95755170,2016-08-20,33876600,Shirley,"Very cute little apartment in a very quiet neighborhood in Salem.  I was a bit curious about what a ""Chauffeur"" Room meant.  It is literally above the garage, so sometimes you can smell the gas/noise when one of the car's enters/ exits.  "
7293821,96073402,2016-08-21,71965882,Louise,Julie was so welcoming and understanding that our arrival was delayed a few hours.  We kept in contact via text about our delay.  She was peacefully waiting for us on her front porch when we arrived.  And she had iced tea ready us.  This home is located in a beautiful neighborhood of established homes and trees.
7293821,97446712,2016-08-27,81959439,John,"Nicer than any hotel room in Salem, for a better price and wonderful friendly people. "

Her home is only a few minutes away from the downtown area but is amazingly quiet, calm and peaceful. The room is clean and well decorated with all the amenities one would need and and even a few extras provided by this gracious host. Thank you Julie!"
7293821,98382123,2016-08-30,29868894,Mary,"The Chauffeurs room was a charming, small apartment above the garage unit.  It was very well appointed and Julie the hostess was very welcoming. The main house is quite beautiful as were the mature trees and the quaint garden. My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer to explore the historic neighborhood and city and relax on the beautiful patio with a glass of wine.  I look forward to our next visit and would definitely stay with Julie again ! "
7293821,99330458,2016-09-04,20781383,Geri,"This property is located close to downtown Salem in a beautiful historic neighborhood.  The apartment was very quaint, and comfortable.

7293821,100708176,2016-09-10,70066155,Valarie,"We had such a wonderful stay in the Chauffeurs room Sept 3-10... the room is so cute and cozy, and is equipped with everything you need. The bed is comfy, the shower is hot and has great water pressure. Julie is a super special lady and we had some great conversations with her...even got to meet her adorable grand-daughter during our stay. We weren't in the room very much, as we chose to spend the majority of our time time exploring wine country, the coast, and the mountains. But coming back every night was like coming home. Julie is so sweet and accommodating, we really, really enjoyed our stay. We'd definitely book here again if coming back to the area. Thank you so much!"

7293821,103591909,2016-09-23,28481247,Mandy,"Julie was the kindest host, checking in to be sure I had everything that I needed, leaving freshly made muffins, and assuring that my stay was better than expected! The apartment was adorable, and comfortable and the perfect escape for a relaxing moment. As I overlooked the beautiful gardens and took in the falling rain, I felt as if I were in a dream land! Julie had prepared far more than I could have expected in terms of breakfast items, tea, bathroom necessities and sweet momentos. The experience far surpassed any expectations! I would recommend this location to anyone and am wanting to go back! "
7293821,104317599,2016-09-26,81548050,Doug,"Julie was friendly and helpful between our booking and arrival and during our stay.

I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Salem. Highly recommend!"
7293821,105695323,2016-10-02,43049568,Melinda,"Julie was a wonderful host. She made everything very comfortable and went out of her way.  And while I stayed in her lovely home instead of the Carriage house because the shower repair wasn't quite complete, it more than exceeded my expectations. Julie was in touch during the week preceding my visit so there were no surprises.  I would definitely return. "
7293821,106181284,2016-10-04,66537202,Andrew (Andy),"It was a wonderful experience staying with Julie!  Although the Chauffeurs Room wasn't available, I stayed in a beautiful room (the Maid's Quarters) in the main house.  Julie and her husband have done a exquisite job of renovating a turn of the century house in a quaint neighborhood of similar large, older, and well kept homes (including the governor's mansion).   The room was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed and an on-suite. 

Julie is the consummate host, always finding just the right balance between being helpful and recognizing your need for privacy.  She was very quick to reply to my request (which I made on the same day as I was seeking accommodation). She even texted me when I forgot an item at the house and offered to mail it to me (fortunately I was still in town).  I am looking forward to staying there again when I am next in Salem!"
7293821,107496676,2016-10-10,89870457,Lenore,I was back for another week!! Julie is the very best host in Salem!! My stay was just as perfect the second time!!

Our accommodations included a comfortable bed, television, dishes, tiny kitchen (fine for us),  nice sized refrigerator, tea, coffee, granola, fresh baked zucchini bread, closet with room to hang clothing and a nice  private bathroom.

When we arrived (early, I might add) she had the most amazing carrot cake muffins for us. Seriously, the best muffins I have ever had. The chauffeurs room is decorated so beautifully. It also has everything you need. Plenty of comfy blankets, 2 heaters. She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. The property and neighborhood are so beautiful. Julie was quick to respond to any questions that I had. It was such and great trip to a beautiful house and a beautiful city."

7293821,116688715,2016-12-02,51317834,Pheebs,Adorable little chauffeur's room above the garage in a fantastic old neighbourhood with a real historic feel. Julie had fresh baked bread for us upon arrival and check in could not have been easier. I'm usually pretty antsy about cleanliness and I did not hesitate to touch anything. The bed linens and bathroom were super clean. The entire place was welcoming and cozy. Very quiet at night and none of the points of interest I went to was more than a ten minute drive away. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in town. Would definitely recommend!
7293821,120325580,2016-12-09,81959439,John,There was plenty of room to practice my nunchuck and bow staff skills. I would recommend this stay for any ninja practitioner. Probably one of the best places to stay in Salem ever!

Thanks Julie!"
7293821,127481656,2017-01-18,15927282,Sybil,"Julie was super nice and welcoming. The property is simply gorgeous, and must have some fascinating Salem history I'd have loved to learn more about. The apartment was lovely and cozy and warm in the midst of a winter storm, and is very private and quiet.

Is above the old carriage house (now a garage) and has a fully equipped kitchen, flat screen TV and great internet service (I had to work quite a bit and never experienced any problem at all).    The bed was incredibly comfortable and we were toasty warm during the chilly nights.  Wonderful goodies in the bathroom to take care of any shower needs and really terrific hair products.   The location is VERY convenient to Willamette U - for all you college parents, it is a perfect place to stay while visiting your student, close to downtown and the U.  The neighborhood is gorgeous and I'd live there in a heartbeat.  Totally enjoyed our stay."

7293821,153773395,2017-05-21,130623069,Liza,"This was my first time with airbnb and I was very nervous about what was ahead. Julie put my mind right at ease from the beginning with her quick responses to my questions before I had even booked the room. Julie accommodated me in every possible way, with little added surprises along the way. The room was very clean, and had everything I needed and more. The bed was comfortable, and the shower perfect. Julie leaves no stone unturned when stocking the room with your needs. The neighborhood was safe, upscale, and very beautiful and scenic. Julie's home is absolutely gorgeous, along with all the other homes in the neighborhood. It was secluded and serene, but just minutes or walking distance from the main street. I would never book anywhere else when visiting Salem but here, if Julie will have me. I without a doubt, highly recommend this room if you want to stay at a place that is your home, away from home, and literally is a little piece of heaven !"

7293821,157401038,2017-06-03,55452532,Brenda,"Our stay at the Chauffer's Room was wonderful!  Julie was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  She has a wonderful flower/vegetable garden that is lovely to walk through, and there is a picnic table to sit and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.  The entire area of Fairmount Hill is stunning, full of well kept historic homes and cottage gardens.  The room was very clean and well furnished and there is a small kitchen area so we were able eat in some nights.  There are many good restaurants within a couple of miles.  We felt at home in this setting and recommend the Chauffer's Room to anyone.  "
7293821,158865939,2017-06-08,23990209,Ian,"It was the perfect place with everything we needed. Beautiful home and landscaping. Safe neighborhood to park your car. Was even able to run to Bush Park from the house. Julie was an excellent host who welcomed us with treats. She was very attentive to our needs, and contacted us right away when we forgot a few things in the refrigerator. Would recommend this place to any couple or someone traveling alone. "
7293821,159797206,2017-06-11,41480549,Erica,"We loved sharing a space in this 1920's Spanish colonial home and the integrative gardening spaces will make you feel like you're on a Mediterranean getaway! This studio space packs a lot of amenities into its larger than expected square footage. This will be our new go-to place to stay for all future Salem travels. 

Thank You Julie!!"

Not only was it comfortable and provided everything needed for my stay, but it had the extra special touches that make you feel right at home. It's one of those rare places that's even better than it looks in the photos. The neighborhood is quiet, the property is beautiful and the hosts are friendly and wonderful. I'll definitely aim to stay here again if I ever need a place in Salem. I can't recommend their place highly enough."
7293821,166884797,2017-07-04,6141318,Vlad,My fiance and I had an amazing stay at the Chauffeurs Room. The place looks even better than the photos.

7293821,178027855,2017-08-04,12299610,David,"Cozy, comfortable, beautifully decorated and extremely well equipped former chauffeur's quarters on a restored 1920s villa in a lovely residential neighborhood in Salem, OR. Our hostess was extremely caring and made sure we were comfortable during an unusual heat wave. She left fruited ice tea and cold watermelon for our arrival. A very nice welcoming touch. We would stay here again without a doubt. A+++!"

Julie's home and grounds are pleasantly landscaped and relaxing. The small apartment itself is above a garage and has a fun attic feel of sorts. Best features include lots of windows, feeling like you're sleeping in the treetops, the pebble floor of the shower, and the handy little kitchenette."

The studio isn't big, but it's well appointed and has everything you need. Plus the property was very peaceful. We sat outside admiring her garden a couple times during our short trip. I highly recommend this place for a couple looking to make Salem their hub."

Once I moved my bag into the house Julie even brought me a tasty/refreshing drink.  It was a fabulous treat making it easy to settle right in for the night.

I would highly recommend Julie's place and plan to stay there again myself.
7293821,206973365,2017-10-27,155650880,Nancy,"The Chauffeur's Apartment at The Villa is comfortable  and perfectly accommodating for two guests. It is clean, thoughtfully appointed, centrally located, and convenient to many nice places to eat. Your host is warm and welcoming. You will find her highly responsive with answers to questions and help coordinating your arrival. She is also forthcoming with recommendations about the area, if you need information or guidance. The apartment is situated behind a handsome house in a gracious neighborhood of elegant older homes and gardens-- very beautiful-- and very convenient to downtown Salem. An excellent value.

7293821,226442952,2018-01-10,66537202,Andrew (Andy),"We rented both the Maid's Room and the Chauffeurs Quarters.  What a unique B&B!  Set in a century old house, the rooms gave insights into early 1900s life in Oregon.  HOWEVER, the real key to our stay was Julie.  It would be hard to find a kinder, more empathetic host!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next visit.  All the usual stuff -- comfy bed, clean, lots of hot water, good cooking facilities. 

It was better than going to stay with Grandma!"

7293821,286229515,2018-07-05,77976080,Angela,Julie was an amazing host! We wanted to go to the 4th of July fireworks and she kindly provided a blanket for sitting on at the park. She greeted us upon arrival and had cookies waiting for us. The neighborhood and her home are beautiful- we would absolutely stay again!
7293821,287921459,2018-07-08,102171227,Nancy,"Julie & Bill are excellent hosts, the location and accommodations are beautiful. We enjoyed sitting out in the lovely garden and eating our breakfast. We highly recommend Julie & Bill's coach house airbnb!"
7293821,288827320,2018-07-10,12118834,Amy,"As we were driving up to the house the first thought that came to mind was “Oh I’d love to live in that house!” And OMG the place is so freakin unbelievably cute! Inside, outside, the manicure grounds plus the usage of the patio and gardens. It’s like a house out of Beverly Hills. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, quiet, clean, and safe! Definitely a small price to pay for a piece of paradise. The accuracy of past reviews drew me to this place. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Julie’s hospitality. I loved that she showed us the suite barefooted. Since for me I’ve accustomed to leaving shoes at the door. The bed is super comfy with it’s high end ensembles. I hope that one day she’d consider her home a bed and breakfast she has all the magical touches and feel to operate one."
7293821,290067020,2018-07-13,42787260,Layne,Julie was a friendly host and her place was just what we needed.  My wife and I were in Salem for a conference so we had little time to enjoy the beautiful landscaped gardens and patio but that would have been wonderful.

7293821,291886982,2018-07-16,3629152,Wilma,Comfortable quiet everything  you need. No air conditioning BUT how often does it get to 95 degrees in Salem also the fans provided helped a lot. Neighborhood was fun to walk around and see historic homes
7293821,294186557,2018-07-21,20946428,David,"This is quite a wonderful alternative to a hotel.  It's located in the heart of one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Salem (a half a block from the Governor's Mansion) and on an amazingly beautiful property.  The unit itself could be called a ""carriage house"" as it's above a portion of the three car the garage.   It is a bit small (maybe 300+ sq. ft.) but it has windows on three sides and the gardens are fabulous.  I'd take my coffee in the morning (a beer in the early evening also) and sit out in the gardens reading my book.  The outdoor aspect of this property was just marvelous!   And it's very centrally located as well.  For about the same price as the very average hotels next to I-5 (I've stayed at several of them) there is no comparison.   "
7293821,296893462,2018-07-26,71492882,Emily Jane,"I always try to stay at Julie's if it is available when I am in town. It's perfect for work travel. Julie provides fresh milk, a cookie, granola, and even had kept the room nicely cool for me on a hot day. It's in a nice neighborhood and very peaceful! "
7293821,297324142,2018-07-27,128888515,James,"It is in a lovely location, in walking distance of several places to eat. Julie’s house is beautiful and we enjoyed sitting in her garden. The room is compact but very clean with a lovely shower and all amenities that you need."

7293821,303169046,2018-08-06,116144483,Pat,Wow!  I wish the ratings had six stars because Julie's place deserves all of them!  Great communication and this space is amazing.  This is the epitome of outstanding Oregon hospitality!  We can't wait to return!
7293821,303622401,2018-08-07,13230659,Amy,"Apartment above the garage - it is the coziest, cutest unit that has everything you need! Very comfortable for a smaller space with a studio feel - bed, 2 leather chairs, micro kitchenette with coffee pot and granola and cookies / pretzels. The bathroom is beautiful - all white tile and spotless. Extras like lotion, eye drops, shampoo / conditioner and soap is all there. The closet has plenty of space to hang clothes, has laundry basket and ironing board. Plus your own refrigerator which Julie thoughtfully puts milk and water in for you. The courtyard outside the house is amazing, as are the gardens and the pergola covered in grape vines. You can really relax here and interact as much or as little as you like. I’ll stay no where else when I return to salem. :)"

7293821,305099651,2018-08-10,13875019,Tim,"Julie’s place was in a very nice neighborhood.  The house and grounds are beautiful and immaculate.  The space is small, but she made good use of it.  I was especially fond of the grotto-like tiled shower.  My only caveat would be if you are a sleeper who needs cool air, and the nights are especially hot, as the place does not have installed A/C.  This did bother us, however.  Julie is a very gracious and helpful host, who I definitely recommend."
7293821,306562710,2018-08-12,22895285,Martha,Our 1st choice to stay while in Salem.

7293821,319198771,2018-09-05,29392944,Kimberly,"We were fortunate that the Chauffer's Room was available for a last minute stay in Salem. The room was lovely.  We slept well in a cozy bed with soft linens and  pillows.  The bathroom was nicely tiled, great shower, and all the necessary amenities.  This small space had everything we desired.  For breakfast we had the most delicious granola, fresh grapes from the garden and coffee.  Julie's garden was in full bloom and she was a gracious and friendly host.  We enjoyed a relaxing reprieve and hope to return again some day."

7293821,338169157,2018-10-18,141893260,Sue,"We had such an amazing stay at Julie and Bill's apartment. The space is totally private, with your own entrance, immaculately clean, super, super quiet and a wonderful oasis in Salem. The gardens are gorgeous and we really enjoyed sitting outside and having a glass of wine, early evening, just enjoying the greenery. We absolutely loved the neighborhood. We enjoyed walking around and exploring - but it was great to be able to walk downtown, with close proximity to lots of restaurants and all that Salem offers. 
Julie and Bill are fabulous hosts -- if we could give them 10-stars we would. Loved all the personal touches they add to the experience. Baked goods when you check in, homemade granola, coffee and tea to start your stay and all the lovely soaps, shampoos and body lotions. Plus.... a comfy bed to die for! Top-notch linens, towels and everything you'd expect to experience in a 4-star hotel. All-in-all a fabulous stay and we would strongly recommend this gem to others. 
Thank you Julie and Bill for such a lovely stay!"
7293821,339653760,2018-10-21,9241849,Stefan,"We stayed at Julie's place for a night and had a pleasant experience! Their home is located in a cute neighborhood of Salem, half a block from the governor's mansion. The room we stayed in, the Chauffeur's Room, is in a detached unit behind the house with a separate entrance with plenty of privacy. Julie met us when we arrived and was super-friendly and gave us some tips for restaurants and bars to check out. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was well-stocked, and didn't run into any problems. We look forward to coming back here again!

Thanks Julie!"

We had a relaxing stay after a very busy day."

The space has been beautifully updated, and I did not feel like there was anything missing that would’ve made my stay better. On top of this, Julie was extremely kind and quick with her communication. Would highly recommend staying in the Chauffeur’s Room."
7293821,410124620,2019-02-09,98327440,John,"The Chauffeur ‘s Room was perfect for my stay in Salem. The design of the room was so well thought out that it felt bigger than it actually was and everything a person needed was supplied. Julie was very welcoming and made me feel at home right away. The main house and gardens were beautiful and historic. The location is great! Downtown, the State Buildings, Willamette University and the Willamette River were all close by. I tried a couple of recommended restaurants and they truly were fantastic. 
Stay in the Chauffeur ‘s Room when you go to Salem!"

The bed was very comfortable and kept us very warm, as did the heaters. We were able to go do our errands for the day and come back to a private and peaceful environment. The only thing that could have been modified was the shower as it was a bit small and awkward for my fiancé who’s about 6 feet tall, however the water pressure was amazing! Overall, we loved our stay and would definitely recommend Julie’s place for anyone looking for a home away from home."
7293821,429328252,2019-03-27,238177111,Emily,"Julie was very nice and the place was cute, clean and looks exactly like the pictures. Didn’t want to leave!:("

I can't say enough about her VERY comfy place, from the amazing bed (best bed I've had of all the many places I've traveled), the big amazing walk-in shower with the best water pressure, the beautiful neighborhood (and it's quiet), to the little treats she left in the studio including the homemade muffins and sourdough bread! It's 1 flight of stairs up to the studio, so if stairs are an issue, that would be my only hesitation. I can't wait to return! Thank you Julie (and Bill, her husband)."

Her and William’s home is amazing.  And the private quarters seems like a quiet, special hideaway from the state’s capitol, even as the Governor’s mansion is nearby.  We didn’t use the A/C even though it was August, but the room didn’t feel stuffy with the windows and fans.  Bed as comfy as could be.  Super quiet.  Loved the little treats Julie presented.  Would definitely recommend!"

The owners responded promptly to all inquiries and our self-check-in was flawless.  The quiet neighborhood is lovely and very convenient to the city.  I realized after our first night that the intermittent sounds I had been hearing were the acorns falling from the large oaks onto the roof adjacent to the windows, which we had open."

Julie provides excellent coffee and granola to jump-start your day, and all the necessities for light cooking are in the apartment.  The location is quiet and lovely, and the garden beautiful. It's a wonderful place to stay."
7293821,530387820,2019-09-15,97408834,Ronda,"This was my second stay and I can’t say enough about Julie’s hospitality. The property is gorgeous, and room spotless, with great decorative touches! It’s my home away from home! I will definitely be back when visiting Salem!!"

Lovely little space above their garage. Owners are very hospitable; Julie met me and walked me up when I arrived!

Will return soon!!!"

The room was darling, loved the walk in shower, everything we needed was there. Set in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Close to everything. Highly recommended!"

7293821,629973778,2020-06-15,117807864,Aaron,"My favorite Airbnb stay so far. Julie was quick to respond, very accommodating, and so friendly. When I entered the Chauffeur's Room, I was very pleased with the quality and charm of everything inside, from the crisp linens to the hidden cave-like shower. The attached house is beautiful, and the gardens and patios of the villa are just regal.  It truly felt luxurious to stay here, and Julie makes an outstanding representative of Salem, Oregon for any traveler."

Much appreciated after arriving on bike from 40 miles away. The neighborhood and garden were even more quiet and peaceful than we expected."
7293821,635971380,2020-07-08,285845130,Carter,I had an amazing stay at this place and I would for sure recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Salme area.

Everything is so comfortable, the shower, the bed, etc. She has a beautiful garden with great energy. We really enjoyed doing meditation in her garden. The neighborhood has a great vibe. People are friendly. Julie is such a genuine person. We felt a great connection with her. We would highly recommend her place to anyone who's looking for a place with a great vibe."
7293821,638205933,2020-07-14,35727714,Cadence,"What a lovely respite from weeks on the road via bicycle! This was such a beautiful and comfortable place to re-charge. Julie and her husband, Bill, were so kind and thoughtful. Julie really went the extra mile with making the space feel cozy with sweet, thoughtful touches like breakfast foods, coffee, tea, yummy sourdough bread with delicious jam! My partner and I felt very relaxed and welcomed and appreciative of all the effort put into this space! I only wish we could have spent more time chatting with them had conditions of social distancing not been in place. Very grateful for the warm conversation we did get to share! Very kind souls for the weary traveler :-)"
7293821,643070549,2020-07-26,26764827,Amy,"Julie and William were lovely hosts. They provided home-cooked breakfast food and were responsive to any requests we had. The space is great, a little small but perfect for a weekend wine-tasting."

The outdoor patio is adorable and the perfect place for morning coffee or a night time drink, it is very private. The neighborhood is also great with lots of historic homes to walk and look at, very safe too. Julie was excellent at communicating with us and even had some items for breakfast prepared and two cookies upon arrival. Would rec this place to family and friends any day!"
7293821,644323077,2020-07-30,79388471,Ken,Wonderful in all manners

Ultimate cleanliness, luxurious linens, lovely gardens, delicious home baked treats...I could go on and on! Their estate is the most beautiful in the best neighborhood in Salem."
7293821,656148313,2020-08-24,38109943,Radha,"Julie’s space is so comfy, cute and quiet. I loved the accessibility to Willamette University and the Life Force Natural Foods coop! The bed was soooooo comfy and walking in the neighborhood was so relaxing with the smell of the many jasmine bushes blooming. I will definitely be back."
7293821,657993038,2020-08-29,232775344,Annie,"Few places top this experience. I can’t wait to return. Julie was such a delight. Fresh muffins, homemade granola!"

7293821,660282155,2020-09-04,65537795,Lucy,"Exceptional in all respects.  
The owners did a fantastic job creating this special space, and their hospitality is second to none."
7293821,661308625,2020-09-06,173184354,Jeanne,"Julie's space is adorable, clean, in a  great location with lots of extra touches and she's very easy to communicate with. Everything was better than expected and I will recommend her spot to everyone!"

All these were topped off by Julie’s warm hospitality and special touches like homemade granola and warm sourdough bread. We were able to truly relax here. Julie went above and beyond!"
7293821,666877916,2020-09-21,161209949,Derek,"Julie’s place was perfect! Their loft space had everything we needed, and the property/ neighborhood is GORGEOUS. 
She left us homemade cookies, and was very kind throughout the duration of our stay."
7293821,669210073,2020-09-28,66675330,Dorothy,"Beautiful space in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. Would certainly recommend this to others."
7293821,669959495,2020-10-01,36830766,Mike,"I spent 3 nights in Julie and Bill’s loft and it was perfect! It’s peaceful, beautifully decorated and set up with everything you should need. As others have said, the bed is super comfortable and the shower is amazing (I didn’t want to get out!), but beyond that, it’s all the little touches that make this suite special. From the baked treat that was left for my arrival, to the extras like granola, honey, milk and raspberry jam. Bill and Julie are both very friendly and welcoming and their property is gorgeous. Looking forward to staying again this week."
7293821,671654342,2020-10-05,296536415,Danielle,"We stayed one night in the chauffeurs room. Julie was there to greet us when we arrived and when we left. There was fresh bread and granola along with other organic breakfast offerings. The bed was super comfortable and the room was very clean. A few things to note, there is a steep staircase leading to the room and the shower has a very low ceiling and entrance-I had to duck to get in it at 5’5”."
7293821,672432712,2020-10-08,36830766,Mike,"I had another great stay and Julie and Bill’s loft. I love the neighborhood and the location is perfect; so close to downtown, Bush Park and Minto Brown Park. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique place to stay in Salem."
7293821,700913858,2020-10-16,5789066,Tyson,Wonderful stay on a wonderful property with wonderful hosts. Thank you!
8255984,47863631,2015-09-21,44022017,Ben,Had a great time! The loft was something else. Real neat venue and so much better than a hotel. The history of the place adds a lot and the size of the space is awesome. But I think the location was the best part. Close to a number of neat shops and eateries in downtown Salem. Especially enjoyed walking over to Archive and Kitchen. 
8255984,50503199,2015-10-12,7323845,Valerie,"What a gorgeous space!  I felt like I had booked a private spa weekend.  The jacuzzi tub, bathrobes, snacks in the cupboard, wine for purchase, beautiful toiletries, art books to peruse--everything made me feel totally pampered.  It's also a great space to entertain--I had other family members over for wine and cheese and also for breakfast, and we barely scratched the surface of all the tools in the kitchen.  I stayed here alone, which was very luxurious.  The place could easily sleep four (there's a pull-down bed in its own area) and maybe one more on the couch, but just be aware that it is a large loft, so no real walls and therefore no bedroom privacy.  It's extremely close to Willamette and all the downtown shops and restaurants.  "
8255984,57203207,2015-12-23,40227619,Lori,"Angela was an extremely gracious hostess.  She knew I was arriving late in the evening so provided me with wonderful Quiche, English muffins and Orange juice for the next morning.  I truly enjoyed my 5 week stay in her gorgeous loft.  It's location was very convenient for me, just 1 mile from Salem Hospital, where I was working.  It is right downtown, with many shops and restaurants within walking distance.  Angela was very responsive to my messages, wanting to ensure that I had everything I needed to feel at home.

The loft is very spacious, with a fully stocked gourmet kitchen, large bedroom with upgraded linens, nice office/2nd bedroom and a large open dining/living room area.  The high ceilings, skylights and tall windows bring so much light into the loft, which I really appreciated.  I also loved the original hardwood flooring and doors dating back to the 1800's.  There also is a beautiful rooftop deck, although the weather didn't cooperate for me to enjoy this as much as I would have liked.  The bathroom (which was surprisingly well stocked with all the toiletries you could possibly need) houses the washer and dryer, which was very important to me on this longer stay.  I truly enjoyed the Jacuzzi soaking tub in the bathroom as well.  The ambiance in the loft is made even nicer by Angela's exquisite furnishings and original works of art as well as by her beautiful plants. 

If someone is looking for something a little bit different and infinitely nicer than your standard Hotel room I would highly recommend a stay in Angela's Downtown Loft!
"
8255984,63353532,2016-02-22,9816955,Mel,"I spent a weekend in the loft as a getaway with my son, and from the moment we walked in the door we were blown away by the space.  Gorgeous and classy, the artwork took my breath away.  The unit is upbeat and colorful, but in a very grown-up sort of way.  The kitchen is extremely well-appointed with everything one might need to prepare and serve meals.  My son and I both agree that our respective beds were among the most comfortable we'd ever experienced-- soft and cozy but with plenty of support.  There are a gazillion light switches, which after you figure them out means that you can adjust the lighting to exactly the mood you want.  The natural lighting in the unit changes considerably throughout the day because of the huge windows and skylight.  I will definitely book again, next time with my husband!  It would also be great for a girls' retreat ~ each of the two beds would comfortably sleep two.  The location is right in the center of everything.  We took Angela's suggestion and did brunch at Busick Court and it was worth the wait.  Angela was super attentive via text (but not hover-y) and made sure we had everything we needed.  She left bagels and juice in the fridge as well as an assortment of soft drinks, and there is an impressive selection of wine available for purchase on the honor system-- she just asks that you leave a check if you choose to open one.  Also, the unit is large enough to contain any amenity you might need (kitchen items, pantry staples, toiletries, paper/pens, etc.) without feeling cluttery.  Many rentals feel like the owners just threw in all their cast-offs, but here the drawers and cabinets are well-organized and it's clear that Angela put a lot of thought into how to make the place feel welcoming.  The dishes and cutlery match, you have the right glasses for whatever you might be drinking, and the appliances are new and in good working order.  I really don't have enough good things to say about our experience here.  If you are ever in Salem and looking for a beautiful place to stay that is convenient and special, look no further.  I will definitely be back and recommend to others."
8255984,71793895,2016-04-28,67827610,Fran,"The loft is lovely, clean and amazingly quiet.  The decor is very nice, with beautiful original fir floors.  Everything you need is there.
Like many lofts in older two story buildings, most of the natural light comes from a large skylight in the center of the loft, over the kitchen area.  This makes the rest of the living area a bit dark.  
The two sleeping areas are open to each other, which is not a problem for a couple. The biggest inconvenience is that the bathroom and sleeping areas are at the opposite end of the loft.  This could be inconvenient for guests who get up at night. "
8255984,74750261,2016-05-16,17383011,Tom And Laurence,"We had an amazing time. The downtown loft is an incredible space! It is wonderfully decorated and superbly appointed. Angela has thought of everything to make the stay perfect, toiletries, bathrobes, wine for purchase, art books, (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very close to Willamette University which was perfect for us as we were in Salem for my son's graduation.  We had my son and a few friends over after graduation for a small celebration and it was very convenient and perfectly luxurious. "
8255984,86831118,2016-07-17,15267485,Monique,"Angela's loft is AMAZING! It is even more beautiful than the photos, and she is an exceptional host!

The fantastic skylight in the kitchen and windows allow you to enjoy the space in total natural light. The loft is already huge, and the open floorplan makes it feel even larger. Thought and care has been put into every detail - Angela has truly thought of everything to make you feel welcome!

She was available and attentive throughout our stay, and made check-in and check-out a breeze. The location in historic downtown Salem is walking distance to many of the landmarks a visitor would want to check off their list.We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Angela's listing to anyone visiting Salem, and would readily stay again if we're back in the area! 

Thank you for making this wedding weekend a success!!"
8255984,95662226,2016-08-20,26224874,Dale Moana,"Angela's loft is absolutely exquisite! The art is world -class, the design and furnishings are top-shelf and the place is immaculate. All the little details including the fully-equipped gourmet kitchen make this place marvelous! Be aware the two sleeping areas are very close to each other with only a partial wall separating them-- as other guests have mentioned. We had problems with the parking situation. Parking on the street in front of the loft is limited to 3 hours each day on each side of the street. Designated parking was not consistently available during our stay.  Construction next door was really loud, which of course Angela has no control over. We would love to stay here again and I'm sure those issues will be resolved by then!"
8255984,96858452,2016-08-24,26596628,Beatriz,Thank you Angela for making my stay home away from home.
8255984,102708395,2016-09-18,15063580,Martha,"We were in Salem for our wedding. Angela went above & beyond the call of duty, which included meeting the groom at the apartment in record time the day of the wedding to let the groom back in after he locked himself out. Angela also accommodated us with a late check-out. The loft is very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to the Salem area. "
8255984,108632912,2016-10-16,95413698,Kristin,Angela provided great communication for parking before arrival.  Loft was sparkling clean!  Bed and linens were very comfortable!

8255984,112806618,2016-11-07,8379075,Mary,Special.  Angela a delight and loft a perfect location and setup.  Thanks for facilitating some special memories.  First trip to Salem and love it!
8255984,116229429,2016-11-28,11982716,Jeanette,Beautifully remodeled loft in downtown Salem with fully equipped kitchen for entertaining.  Angela is a most helpful and gracious host.
8255984,129707231,2017-02-01,91355161,Margaret,Great spot and beautiful home. Host is wonderful!
8255984,143849532,2017-04-13,5417473,Kenny,"Walking into Angela's stunningly beautiful Airbnb loft, we immediately said ""This is the most unbelievable Airbnb we've ever seen.""  Walking around the 2,400 square foot apartment was a visual treat.  Anything you could possibly want/need on a two day trip was there, including Angela's welcome notes and two mini-bottles of local wine.  She is a great host.

There are a few issues that keep this from being a five-star rating.

1)  It's a second-story loft with a steep 24-step staircase which is a bit much (especially for lugging up suitcases), even for two in-shape seniors.  Angela told us that she plans to install an elevator eventually . . . but be forewarned that this is not an easy ascent or descent.

2) Inexplicably, the bathroom and master bedroom are located at opposite ends of the loft.  Very inconvenient for those of us that wake up several times a night to pee.  It's the only significant design flaw in an otherwise outstanding property.

3) The neighborhood.  While I wouldn't say it's ""bad,"" it's located a block away from the homeless shelter and the spillover sleeps on the ""street where we lived.""  We came back to the loft at 10 p.m. and had to step over two men who were sleeping at our entrance.  They were harmless, but when you're paying top dollar to stay in an airbnb, you shouldn't have to worry about stuff like this.

So there are clear dichotomies about this experience.  Luxury that you can't believe (the jacuzzi tub was put to good use), but a lot of inconveniences to overcome.

I am sure Angela is going to work on making this a better experience for her tenants.  The elevator will help.  The relocation of the homeless shelter will help.  I'm not sure she can do anything about the bathroom being so far away from the bedroom . . . I'm sort of dumbfounded that the architects didn't realize what they were doing when they built/designed the loft.

So overall . . . four stars which, with the aforementioned tweaks, would be an easy five."
8255984,148476349,2017-04-30,61121818,Josh,"Angela is a great host amd was so easy to communicate with, before and during our stay. Not only this, She possesses one of the most quaint loft properties in all of Downtown Salem. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! "
8255984,156200401,2017-05-29,127857976,Erick,This place is a hidden gem.  I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area.  We had a great time.
8255984,157739471,2017-06-04,64913509,Forest,"This place completely exceeded my expectations, the photos do not do it justice.  This place is walking distance from quite a few shops, restaurants and shopping outlets.  The communication from Angela and willingness to make sure we are enjoying our stay was unexpected and made us feel so at home we want to make this an annual trip.  

Thank you Angels! :)"
8255984,180908448,2017-08-11,24405019,Todd,Excellent and beautiful loft by a wonderful host Angela.  She took care of every need and was very responsive in her communication.  We really enjoyed our stay and having such a clean/tastefully appointed rental was perfect for our vacation.

8255984,197197160,2017-09-24,20038754,Jonna,"The pictures just don't do it justice.  What a lovely place to stay.

We had a wonderful time and found the loft better than described.

The only thing to be aware of is that the flight of stairs is long.  Worth every step and since it's longer than normal, you're rewarded with a nice view of the street life below."
8255984,198245961,2017-09-28,43547442,Liesl,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!! A perfect getaway right in the middle of downtown Salem. The space is welcoming, beautiful, and amazingly quiet. The kitchen is well stocked and a delight to cook in. Angela is a conscientious, attentive and responsive host. Walking distance to shopping, a beautiful park, and numerous restaurants. As another review mentioned, there is a hefty flight of stairs to negotiate (although Angela mentioned an elevator is to be installed sometime in Spring, 2018), and there's just the one (beautifully appointed) bathroom. It was perfect for us, though, and it will DEFINITELY be our first choice for lodging whenever we're in Salem!"
8255984,199356038,2017-10-01,143085009,Doug,It is a beautiful space in downtown Salem. Very convenient
8255984,203257383,2017-10-14,143172844,Sandra,Great loft downtown Salem! Would definitely recommend.
8255984,204363807,2017-10-17,18916001,Kalila,"Delightful, spacious and beautiful.  Glad we chose this space to stay while in Salem."
8255984,206969440,2017-10-27,150434489,Tammy,Angela was fantastic. She met all of our requests with a cheerful attitude. The loft had so many thoughtful touches and extras. The pictures seriously do not  do it justice. Had friends over for dinner and it was a fun hang out! Highly recommended!!
8255984,208504247,2017-11-01,100101566,Jessica,I felt like I found a price of treasure ! This worked out perfect for a wedding I had for a place to meet and stay over. What a wonderful space and amazing host! Angela went out of her way and accommodated for us and the place was amazing beyond what I expected. Can’t wait to share this place.
8255984,209662193,2017-11-05,5872757,Caitilin,"This is so much more than a beautiful home--it's almost an art gallery! Smack dab in the middle of the incredibly walkable downtown, we were spoiled by the thoughtful and beautiful accommodations as well as the great choices in restaurants within just a few blocks. 

We were in Salem for a Willamette University reunion, and loved the fact that it was an easy walk from campus. The loft itself was very comfortable, and quiet despite being in the heart of downtown. Kitchen and bath were well-stocked, and beds were very comfy (hard to get out of them!). 

The only drawback was that the loft is about one block from the Union Gospel Mission, which meant that a woman might not feel comfortable walking alone after dark, but that's true of much of Salem. And of course, the cold rainy weather (no fault of our host) meant that we could not enjoy the rooftop deck."
8255984,212016157,2017-11-15,58194293,Laura,"Angela's loft was the perfect location & wonderfully comfortable space for us.  My husband, daughter & I traveled to Salem to visit colleges, and brought another couple with us as well.  There was plenty of space and we enjoyed the kitchen very much.  It's beautifully decorated w/ everything needed, very clean & quick WiFi.  Thanks, Angela!  We will absolutely stay at your loft next time in Salem.  Cheers!"
8255984,214811048,2017-11-26,66347762,Liz,"Angela was awesome, very quick to respond to texts!
Flat was lovely, clean and in a great location, close to everything.
We will be back,
Thank you!"
8255984,217106640,2017-12-07,127601866,Marci,"The Loft is amazing!! Its beautiful, quiet, well furnished, and absolutely amazing! I've been staying in airbnbs non stop since May and this is by far my favorite! I can't wait to go back! Its in walking distance to shopping, entertainment, restaurants, etc..you'll have no option but to just ENJOY."
8255984,217992309,2017-12-10,52120279,Lauren,This loft is absolutely gorgeous and I would recommend it to anyone interested! We had our rehearsal dinner there and then my bridesmaids and I stayed there and got ready for the wedding! Such a beautiful space and the tub is amazing! Angela is one of the best hosts we've had in all our Airbnb stays and I'm so glad I got to start my married life in such an amazing place!
8255984,228224715,2018-01-18,127601866,Marci,"The Loft is beautiful, stylish, but so warm and wekcoming. I travel 22 days of every month, the last 7 months, and this is by far my favorite place to stay. During the day you have all kinds of shopping, restaurants, and things to do, all within walking distance. At night the street quiets down and its a peaceful place to stay! I'm headed back in a few days and consider myself fortunate to do so!"
8255984,229459061,2018-01-23,43218340,Kim,"Angela's loft feels like a 5 star hotel.  The loft is spacious, yet homey.  It's well appointed with beautiful art and special touches throughout.  We especially loved climbing into a comfy beds with a heated mattress pads.  There were lots of luxurious towels and even yummy robes to cuddle up in.  Entry and check-in were well orchestrated, which made it all very easy.  One note is that loft has no elevator so be prepared to carry your suitcase to the second floor.  This really wasn't a problem at all for us, but just wanted to give a heads up to those who it might be.  The kitchen was well appointed with everything you'd want, and there was a lovely book with suggestions, directions, and more. Angela was  quick to respond when we had a concern and went above and beyond to accommodate us.  The loft is right in the midst of downtown Salem with lots of interesting shops and places to eat right out the door."
8255984,231532096,2018-02-01,127601866,Marci,"The loft is absolutely beautiful! Everything you need is there for a wonderful stay. I love staying here, its my favorite!"
8255984,243369909,2018-03-15,127601866,Marci,"What a wonderful place to stay, I love it. Its my favorite by far! Angela is a wonderful host, quick responses and makes you feel very welcome."
8255984,248157448,2018-03-30,127601866,Marci,"I spend approximately 24 days of the month on the road for business. I have been lucky enough to spend several different stays here at The Loft, most of them 9 or 10 nights at a time. This is by far my favorite place! I love how comfortable but stylish it is. I love how close it is to dining, shopping, local events, and working in Salem I can be any closer to work. Its downtown Salem on Commercial street with everything going on but when you enter the doors of The Loft it all disappears. Its so quiet and peaceful inside. I look forward to my next stay. Angela is the best hostess, all the little touches are there, she know how to make one feel at home. Thank you Angela!"
8255984,252947854,2018-04-12,127601866,Marci,I can't say enough positive things about Angela and The Loft! I love it there and so will you!
8255984,262987736,2018-05-10,127601866,Marci,"The Loft is amazing! If anybody has a chance to stay there they should. It's beautifully furnished, it's well taken care of, always spotless, well decorated, and obviously well-loved. It's on Commercial Street walking distance to everything including the nightlife but also very quiet place to stay. Always available parking I've stayed there multiple times and have loved every one of them thanks Angela for being the perfect Hostess look forward to my next day"
8255984,264790392,2018-05-14,38610509,Susan,"Angela’s home exceeded all our expectations. We felt as if we were staying in the beautiful home of an old friend. In addition to a great location, sparkling cleanliness, comfortable beds, ample provisions of towels, blankets, shampoo, condioner, & lotions, her kitchen and pantry far exceeded anything we expected or imagined. 
Angela herself is a responsive, attentive host with a real gift for hospitality. We wholeheartedly recommend this, or any of the properties with which she is involved as owner, or co-host."
8255984,275318961,2018-06-10,90935503,Amanda,Angela’s venue is gorgeous with so many unique pieces of history! My husband and I needed a space to throw our baby shower and it was absolutely perfect! Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the loft! Angela was a great host and so accommodating and quick to respond when we needed anything. I highly recommend the Airbnb experience that she provides!
8255984,306578521,2018-08-12,174439506,Steve,Beautiful loft very roomy feels like home! You can’t find a better location if you plan on shopping in Salem or just adventure downtown!
8255984,332638620,2018-10-05,7654346,Krysti,Angela was a wonderful host. Her place is really cool. I found myself just walking around looking at all of the eclectic artwork. It was very clean and spacious. We would definitely stay there again.
8255984,334958620,2018-10-10,48523484,Elaine,Angela’s place in downhill Salem is outstanding. It gets five stars for pretty much everything. I would stay here again without hesitation.
8255984,347749035,2018-11-11,102493952,Carolyn (Mandy),Great space and location! Angela was very prompt with responses to questions and provided information about local dining and shopping options! Would definitely stay here again!
8255984,348917092,2018-11-15,35329074,Bob,"A stylish, modern, comfortable living space awaits anyone staying at Angela's loft.  The location is excellent and the  space is well equipt for relaxing or entertaining. Intersesting art, comfortable beds, an outside deck, a jetted tub for 2, a gourmet kitchen and a great supply of books movies and games to pass the time are provided.  A hidden gem."
8255984,354135389,2018-11-30,227213107,Patricia,"Beautiful space, comfortable furnishings, well equipped bath and kitchen, the heart of great food and drink in downtown Salem. Loved my 5 night stay, thank you Angela!"
8255984,432720175,2019-04-04,27790501,Jeff,"I was in town for work at the Capitol, and Angela’s home was a great place to enjoy Salem. Everything seemed to be just a few blocks away - great restaurants, coffee and a wonderful new park along the river. In fact, I didn’t need to drive anywhere! Angela’s home was really slick - on the second floor of a historic building right in the heart of downtown Salem, the condo is spacious, clean and super convenient. The dance studio’s music below was rockin’ a couple of night, but it did’t go really late and wasn’t much of a bother to me. Angela was helpful and responsive as well. All around a great spot. You’ll enjoy it!"
8255984,436710808,2019-04-13,179252688,Chris,Very nice space with tons of room and perfectly located in the downtown area.  Angela is responsive to any and all requests or needs - thanks a million.
8255984,463151865,2019-06-02,86300508,Milo,"The loft was really cool, and close to a lot of places to eat and drink. Rooftop was fun, we had a drink up there. Try this place out!!"
8255984,468506939,2019-06-12,257437227,Randy,"The loft in downtown Salem was great! The space is very open and super stylishly decorated. It’s located near great restaurants and bars, and Angela responds to all communications promptly. We’d definitely come back!"
8255984,505780629,2019-08-09,185365531,Brenda,Angela’s home is beautiful and her style is eclectic. She has created a one-of-a -kind experience that elevates the vacation experience. My family loved every minute of our time there.
8255984,513650290,2019-08-19,28885526,Carey,This is the second time we have stayed at one of Angela's properties and it did not disappoint. The proximity to Riverfront Park was great for our stay and there was a great cafe around the corner for breakfast sandwiches in the morning. Unique place and worked for the three guys that stayed there. One bedroom is on its own next to the bathroom while the other sleeping areas are separated by a 3/4 wall. You can't see over it but if you have anyone who snores it could be a problem for a light sleeper. We look forward to booking with Angela next year!
8255984,516008952,2019-08-23,45159863,Richard,"Very convenient location. Close to restaurants, shopping and walking. Loft is elegant and well equipped with lots of nice touches."
8255984,520054061,2019-08-29,174614319,Goldy,Great location in the middle of downtown Salem. And it’s a very stylish place!
8255984,535590103,2019-09-24,17296764,Herb,"Large, clean and very well located in downtown Salem.  Really good space for gatherings such as a family get-together.  The kitchen is absolutely outstanding with every kitchen appliance and utensil you might ever need.  We never saw Angela (or needed to) but, should you need her, she is available by message on short notice"
8255984,539188732,2019-09-30,28361084,William,This unit is very well located in the heart of Salem close to shops and restaurants.  Angela was helpful and easy to work with.  The place is tastefully furnished with a great kitchen and comfortable living room area.   Open floor plan with lots of space.
8255984,544687096,2019-10-10,72929112,David,"Awesome place! If I ever need to stay in Salem for work again, I will be back."
8255984,546507838,2019-10-13,30571473,Bailey,"Angela’s loft is a great place to stay with a large group or just for two people. We loved the location and the fact their is parking is an additional plus. If you want to stay in for dinner, the kitchen is full if anything you’ll probably need. Want to go out? You’re close to some of our favorite restaurants. I would definitely stay here again or at another one of Angela’s properties."
8255984,552896088,2019-10-22,294944277,Dawnmarie,"Amazing place, great location with tons of great restaurants close by, this ones a winner!"
8255984,553653607,2019-10-24,76097888,Clint,"At the risk of not being able to get into this place again, if Salem is on your itinerary this is a stylish vintage-y stay in the State Cap!  Really a fantastic space that looks and feels like you're stepping into a 1962 cocktail party."
8255984,558216712,2019-11-02,53506242,Agustus,"Great place! Everything you need including pots pans, spices, towels, shampoo conditioner soap etc. jacuzzi tub is a treat!"
8255984,563469880,2019-11-12,25161152,Lori,"We had to cancel our reservation on the day we were due to arrive on account of the airline canceling our flight (weather conditions) and unable to rebook us until two days later.   While we can't opine on the place, we can say that Angela was very responsive throughout.  She also graciously offered to ask Airbnb to refund us 2 out of the 5 nights which we certainly appreciated as we didn't have trip insurance."
8255984,607437605,2020-02-17,26299371,Tom,Angela is a superb host! Would highly recommend her stylish loft to anyone needing a central accommodation in Salem. About the only thing we didn't care for were the long flight of stairs!
8255984,621164008,2020-03-28,9816955,Mel,"This is the second time my son and I have stayed in Angela’s loft and it was even better than we remembered it. The loft is gorgeously appointed with amazing art, cozy furniture, and everything you might need or want in terms of pantry items, bath essentials, and more. We binge watched Netflix in the cozy TV nook. This time Angela had a complimentary bottle of wine waiting and it was just perfect. I also have to say that the master bed is SO gigantic and comfortable, and now has an electric bed warmer which I loved. The unit is huge and there are plenty of spaces for working, eating, and lounging. Will definitely come back! Highly recommended for a couple, small group of friends, or in my case a mom-son getaway weekend."
8524259,185526834,2017-08-21,145548216,Christina,"Let me start with ""I am so thankful to Nancy and this wonderful experience"".  I stayed 2 nights at this place for photographing solar eclipse, which was an amazing event. but my soul was enriched and received more than that,  Nancy's warmness, kindness, sincerity truly made me felt like family while I stayed there.  Her communication was always right on, she did extra mile effort to make sure I was comfortable at her house.  Her cooking was awesome and delicious, plenty of food, fresh fruit, Zen garden, quiet environment, friendly nice neighborhood.  I really enjoyed this stay so much.  I will give 10 stars on all category easily.   Nancy, Thank You so very much for all you'd done.   I am so thankful, and definitely and absolutely recommend this place to everyone. and I definitely will stay at this place again when I revisit Oregon.  :)"
8524259,276419627,2018-06-13,24919674,Barbara,Nancy's place is lovely and modern. ..well appointed and a great location.  Nancy was very hospitable and sharing.  You need to provide your own breakfast but that's not a problem as a fantastic supermarket is very close.  Great host...great stay.
9238563,55161636,2015-11-28,49558614,Matthew,"My wife, son, and I visited this lovely apartment on Thanksgiving Day. We were actually the first to stay with Steven and Robin. Based upon our visit, I expect many more visits to come both from us and from the AirBnB community. Lovely space, well priced, no hassle, and great hosts. What's not to love? We look forward to visiting again!"
9238563,56013039,2015-12-07,8448060,Gabrielle,Steven and Robin were wonderful hosts and we greatly enjoyed our time in Salem. Their house was clean and lovely. They even left little chocolates for us. Great stay!
9238563,56518669,2015-12-14,48634128,Megan,Great experience! The apartment was very well stocked and tastefully decorated. Robin and Steve were very accommodating and communicative. Would definitely stay again. A++
9238563,56801504,2015-12-18,42923296,Georgi,"We were visting my brother in Salem and it was also my 22 year old granddaughter's birthday.  Although our visit was short it was quite nice. The space fit our needs perfectly.  We even took advantage of the sauna tucked away in the laundry/bath area.  At first we were quite chilly, but per our host's instructions we texted him and he upped the heat.  Then it was quite comfy. They provided some coffee and oatmeal for the morning.  They also have a piano which we tried our minimal repertoire on.  Their floors were lovely and came with numerous caveats about getting them wet.  I imagine they wish they had installed something less beautiful and more durable."
9238563,57063577,2015-12-21,15942198,Joe & Jean,"John greeted us after a long day on the road and showed us the spotless and very comfortable accommodations on our arrival.  Their suite has all the expected conveniences AND a super-inviting sauna (that, unfortunately, we didn’t have the time to enjoy). If you like a Tempurpedic mattress (not just the pad-over-the -mattress kind) you’ll sleep well here! We enjoyed talking with John and Robin and our short stay at their home on our trip moving our daughter from San Francisco to Seattle. Highly recommended."
9238563,59919469,2016-01-17,51443039,Lara,"Steve and Robin are kind, respectful and a sizable if you need them. Sauna is very relaxing. Beautiful, quiet home. "
9238563,61174986,2016-02-01,51443039,Lara,"Felt like I was I my own home. Safe, beautiful neighborhood close to everything but also quiet. You will not find kinder, more respectful, caring people than Steve And Robin. Apartment has beautiful patio and sauna in your private bathroom. Thank you for everything Steve and Robin. "
9238563,61860826,2016-02-08,12621220,Arlene,"After reading many discouraging hotel reviews, we turned to Air bnb and found Steve & Robin's place.  It was as all of the other guests had written.  Very clean, quiet, and we were free to come and go as we pleased.  We briefly met Steve who kindly invited in for a glass of wine, but then our dinner guests showed up so we left.  We are sorry we didn't get a chance to visit with them more.  We didn't make use of the sauna, but maybe next time.  Very spacious.  We will most definitely stay with them again, and hopefully this time, we can visit with them more.  "
9238563,62474477,2016-02-14,693453,Ariana,"This space was awesome - we LOVED the sauna after a long night of helping an artist friend put on a food event at a local winery. The mattress is firm, high-quality memory foam and it was super comfortable! As stated, this Air B&B is located in a neighborhood, so we did hear a dog barking in the early morning. The space is completely separate from the living space of the owners of the home - it's located underneath their house, so we did hear footsteps once or twice, which was no big deal for us. When we arrived there were breakfast burritos in the freezer, a wine bottle opener, sparkling mineral water, and thick, fluffy towels in the bathroom. Also, a small dish of chocolates! Very well-appointed space, and the hosts were really kind, cool people. Since it's on the West side of Salem, it's closer to the wineries located in the area then other places located in the Salem area. All in all, a great experience, and we will totally go back there if we ever need a place to stay in Salem!"
9238563,62664263,2016-02-15,2357190,Magz,Beautiful sweet space. We weren't there long but Steve and Robin were friendly and their space was inviting! 
9238563,62939059,2016-02-18,9407895,Jack,"Steve and Robin were at the place when we arrived and what a sweet couple they are! There were some welcome gifts and breakfast supplies ready to go. The apartment is very comfortable, great bed and bedding, and a sauna that was a real treat. Whilst Steve and Robin maintained our privacy, they let us know that if we needed anything, they were just upstairs (we didn't but it was nice to know). All in all, a delightful stay in a very nice apartment in quiet neighborhood close to downtown. Perfect, and many thanks!"
9238563,63327358,2016-02-22,15944865,Tanja,Robin and Steve made us feel welcome from the very start. They contacted us ahead of time giving us access info. They have a beautiful home. Very clean and details for comfort were thought through.
9238563,64122623,2016-02-29,58292702,Shane,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Steve and Robins' listing! From the start to the finish they were very good as regards timely communication, making me feel very comfortable about where I would be staying. This was my first Airbnb stay, and it was a good experience. And this listing is larger than I had imagined it would be. It's very well maintained and kept superbly clean! I felt very comfortable and most importantly- safe. If I ever need to stay in Salem again, I'd love to stay here-and this time enjoy the sauna! "
9238563,64428522,2016-03-04,6063586,Barbara,"Steve and Robin were very kind.  They brought by some delicious decaf and homebaked muffins one morning and even provided a blender for making smoothies!  Communication was good and they made us feel welcome.  The rooms are very spacious, and the bed in the bedroom was comfortable (the sofa bed not so much, beware).  Despite the description, there isn't a kitchen, just a microwave and a small frig, so I wouldn't plan on preparing any food.  Currently there isn't really a cozy spot to hang out and read a book, have a glass of wine, play a game, or just enjoy some conversation -- just a couple of bar chairs at the bar and two couches with no tables or reading lamps.  But this could easily be remedied with a little furniture rearrangement and the addition of a reading lamp, a coffee or end table, and an armchair to the love seat."
9238563,64791726,2016-03-08,51964219,Cheryl,We enjoyed our stay in Steve and Robin's lovely suite. It was clean and comfortable. Communication was clear and prompt anytime we needed anything. We would love to stay again the next time we visit Salem.
9238563,65300652,2016-03-12,52189395,Ashanti,"The space is in a downstairs area below the main house where the hosts stay.  With the layout of the house, we were presented with a very spacious and cozy feeling living space, and we also felt a great sense of privacy.  The space is well complimented by the nice hard wood flooring and the sauna was a nice touch to unwind after a long day.

The room is nice and spacious with the bed offering a warm and cozy night's rest.

The bar style counter with bar stools was a nice area to do work in the middle of the night with excellent lighting.

Having this visit be a quick one night stay, we didn't have much time to interact with the hosts, but they definitely made us feel very welcome and were easy to reach through text messaging.  Before checking out, they came an  introduced themselves making the experience more personable and greatly appreciated."
9238563,65814213,2016-03-17,57673441,Tanya,"GORGEOUS suite, perfect location for Salem and surrounding areas!  Steve and Robin have provided everything you could want and the sauna is icing on the cake!  Privacy galore, but Robin and Steve were readily available for any questions.  We needed something sent from home and they went out of their way to assist!   5 stars!"
9238563,67882909,2016-04-01,57640927,Bryant,"We enjoyed our stay here in West Salem. The house was as described and we were welcomed with sparkling water and chocolate. Shampoo, soap etc. was offered in the bathroom. Coffee, breakfast and tea was offered as well. Robin and Steve were really nice to us and took my girlfriend to church, while I was working. Thank you for a pleasant stay! We might be back this summer "
9238563,68586283,2016-04-05,40340667,Mike,"This place was fantastic. The directions for getting in were spot on, there was a nice welcome sign with candy for us. Steve and Robin came down to meet us and brought a bottle of sparkling water. Breakfast was provided. Fantastic stay. Thanks!"
9238563,68708358,2016-04-06,23833586,Bob,"What a great space!  Well cared for with lots of little touches (Keurig coffee pods, chocolates, etc.).  Steve and Robin made us feel very welcome and take pride in being good hosts."
9238563,69030971,2016-04-08,22930869,Russel & Jenna,"This space was the perfect R&R place for us-clean, cozy & quiet! We loved the sauna and kitchen addition. The location was ideal to downtown and we would recommend this Airbnb location to anyone! We will stay here again for sure."
9238563,69535933,2016-04-11,26326604,Stuart,Fantastic place to stay. Beautiful part of Salem and the house was nicer than advertised. You can't go wrong. 
9238563,71131765,2016-04-23,13453657,Robin,We were greeted with a welcome sign in the rental upon arrival. The neighborhood is very quite and accessible. The hosts were gracious and provided breakfast foods for our convenience. They were extremely responsive to emails. The unit looked as described in the listing. I would have no problem recommending this location to other renters.
9238563,71180167,2016-04-24,16479868,Michael,"The room was clean, well appointed and welcoming, thanks.  "
9238563,71899862,2016-04-29,52830360,Heather,"Great little apartment close to the freeway, but not too close. We only stayed one night but it was a great experience ! Beautiful home with a nice, clean, roomy apartment attached. We had the opportunity to have a nice chat with Robin and she was delightful! I would defiantly recumbent this apartment for anyone looking for a luxury apartment to stay in, but still nice and cozy. "
9238563,77165774,2016-05-30,20832959,James,"First off - me and my girlfriend were traveling from Seattle, and had spent a couple nights in Portland before getting into Salem for a wedding at 3pm.  We contacted Steve and Robin about the possibility of checking in a little early seeing as how usually check-ins aren't until 3 or 4pm.  They were prompt and responded quickly and let us know that if the previous guests were leaving early they would do their best to have it ready earlier.  5 stars for customer service alone!  We were in luck and the previous guests had checked out early, so Steve and Robin let us know right away that they would have the suite ready for us when we arrived in at 2pm.  This saved us a lot of trouble, and put our minds at east so we wouldn't have to be frantically getting ready as soon as we arrived.  

Robin greeted us upon arrival and showed us the Suite, which looks even better in person.  She was super friendly and even wrote a welcome note laid out with chocolates and a stocked breakfast bar.  

Couldn't ask for more hospitality, stay was superb all across the board.  Great location, only a 10 minute drive to Zenith vineyards where our friend's wedding was.  

Thank you Steve and Robin!"
9238563,77905836,2016-06-04,41970246,Kristina,"Steve and Robin met us when we parked, and were warm and welcoming. Their home is beautiful, on a tucked-away street. The lower level is yours and it's updated, tastefully decorated and relaxing. They left breakfast burritos, oatmeal, tea and coffee, and some chocolates for us to enjoy the night and next morning. The sauna is lovely, soap/shampoo, towels are provided, and the bed was very comfortable! I would definitely come back to this peaceful, deluxe location. Thank you Robin and Steve!"
9238563,78194591,2016-06-05,2818190,Steve,"The hosts were wonderful, as was the space. The neighborhood was especially nice with the listing being on a quiet & lovely flower-filled block. "
9238563,79092197,2016-06-11,73871997,Diana,"This is a lovely little downstairs suite in a quiet neighborhood. Steve and Robin showed us in and made us feel right at home. The information says they provide ""necessities"" like shampoo and soap, but there were so many other little things that made this place special, like being greeted with chocolates and sparkling water, and the yummy breakfast burritos and hot chocolate in the morning, and the fancy soaps and comfortable bedding. We highly recommend the location and the hosts! "
9238563,79731835,2016-06-13,33314569,Kathleen,"We spent three nights at Steve and Robins lovely room. Our son was graduating from OSU in Corvallis and we were welcomed with a sign congratulating him. Very thoughtful! The room was so clean, spacious and comfortable! It was just like the pictures that were posted. One surprise that I enjoyed was the little garden sitting area just outside the sliding door. A great place to drink some tea or read for a while.  They had everything we needed and it was decorated beautifully, especially the bedroom and bathroom. We had an extra day after the graduation so we took their suggestion and drove to Silver Falls State Park. That was a highlight of our trip and was only about an hour away. We really enjoyed our stay in Salem!"
9238563,80099468,2016-06-16,66571827,Anne,"Steve & Robbin are really nice people and were very interested in us (where we come from, where we planned to go to). We were very welcome to use their house en would come back again !"
9238563,80811040,2016-06-19,10513864,Jonathan,"Steve & Robin were very accommodating and their apartment was exceptionally clean and comfortable for our family of four. We especially enjoyed the sauna during our three-night stay. The kitchenette includes a sink, microwave and flatware and allowed for making simple meals. A brand new grill awaited us on the patio which we made great use of. We would definitely stay here again!"
9238563,81021745,2016-06-20,76461195,Daniel,Steve and Robin were awesome and great host. They made us feel right at home and their place was absolutely beautiful. This was my first time using Airbnb and was blown away with how easy and great of a home this was. Would do it again. 
9238563,81334243,2016-06-22,55063318,Maribeth,Really nice place. Comfortable bed and relaxing environment. Will definitely stay here again. 
9238563,81879673,2016-06-25,39055426,Jim,"Well we got to Robin and Steves home in the PM coming from Az and everything was set up for  us. We came to Orgon for our oldest Gdaughters wedding and did not get back to their home until  late. Not a problem. Robin met us in the morning, how sweet and caring Lady. Steve came to meet us and he is cool guy. The home was set up super, well what we wanted, west Salem close to everything,"
9238563,82169865,2016-06-26,8963043,Salena,"Wonderfully clean and well appointed, the owners provide a super-clean BnB with soft bedding and fresh new towels. The sauna was a delightful treat after a long bike ride. You can hear footsteps upstairs, so light sleepers should take note, but otherwise it is comfortable, spacious and far above the usual BnB. An elegant daylight basement retreat! Robin was a gracious and welcoming host. I recommend!"
9238563,82986750,2016-06-30,74850843,Amanda,"A very nice space! Close enough to the highway to get around, but far enough away to feel homey. Loved the sauna! Instructions were clear, and everything was clean and safe."
9238563,83354317,2016-07-02,35810597,Donna,very quiet and peaceful.
9238563,83940279,2016-07-04,18595542,Andrew,"Steve and Robin were incredibly friendly and welcoming, even providing us with some sparkling water on arrival. It served as an excellent home base for Silver Falls and Eola-Amity and lower Wilamette Valley AVA. Only downside which was minor was the house transits sound easily from upstairs, but this was not a problem during normal sleeping hours. Overall, nice people and a nice place to stay."
9238563,84478949,2016-07-07,37604701,Joshua,"Steve and Robin were great hosts for our family of four. Their home was just as described and our family felt right at home in this space. We chose to stay here because it was close to both Portland and Eugene. The neighborhood was nice and seemed very safe. My wife particularly enjoyed the colorful flowers and seating area outside. If we had spent longer we would have used the grill outside too. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to my family and friends. "
9238563,85108970,2016-07-10,18928677,Lori,"Steve and Robin were very personal, warm, and welcoming to us. They provided everything they said, and the space was exactly as expected and lovely."

9238563,87396811,2016-07-19,59770850,Nancy,The hostess came out and greeted us. She was very nice. The neighborhood was lovely and convenient for our destination. 
9238563,87699489,2016-07-21,10952700,Meghan,Lovely basement level flat. Very clean and comfortable with a thoughtful bottle of sparkling water in the fridge and a nice kitchen setup. I was in town for work and enjoyed staying at their very comfortable apartment / flat. Kindly provided instructions on parking and entry ahead of time to make the arrival easy.

9238563,90260534,2016-07-31,16153560,Shauna,"Great place to stay! Comfortably sleep 4 people, clean, well appointed and location was excellent to local wineries. We attended a wedding at a neighboring winery, and had no problem getting there and back.  Regretfully didn't have time to try sauna, will definitely stay here again if in the area.   Host had a great selection of teas and coffee for the morning along with breakfast burritos. All around great experience."
9238563,91475696,2016-08-05,76021872,Desiree,"Great, we got in late and it was no problem. We had privacy and the space was very nice. "
9238563,92344766,2016-08-08,16258691,Aron,"Steve and Robin are absolutely great - you can tell they care a lot about their guests comfort. We were very fortunate to be able to meet them during our stay. 

The suite maybe the nicest Airbnb accommodation that I've experienced. It's spacious, has a lovely living room space, and the outdoor patio was perfect for a morning coffee. 

I highly recommend staying here if you're looking to explore Salem and the surrounding area!

The bathroom was very well-appointed and the coffee/breakfast station was perfect. Robin thoughtfully left a little greeting for us, chilled sparkling water and homemade oatmeal cookies!

The location was very convenient to Willamette University and local amenities like grocery and drug stores.

We took the slow route to Portland and visited small wineries on the way, very close to Steve and Robin's place. A nice side trip!"
9238563,98138766,2016-08-29,87387041,Judy,"Robin and Steve were very welcoming! The pictures are great but the actual space is amazing! We had more space than we needed, the property was private and the location was extremely peaceful! We couldn't have asked for a better experience. "

9238563,102626791,2016-09-18,51866989,Renae,"Robin and Steve were such gracious hosts! They were leaps and bounds more than accommodating, so whether you're more of an independent traveler who would appreciate privacy, or a social traveler who welcomes their company---they know how to read their guests. I was in town for work and when I needed my quiet time I had it; and when I needed some friendly conversation they were great enough to chat. All in all, I'd HIGHLY recommend them! 
P.s. The sauna such an awesome treat!!"
9238563,102928500,2016-09-19,6312947,Adrienne,"Steve and Robin's suite was one of the nicest and most comfortable places I've stayed. Everything was super clean and well taken care of. Their house is in a lovely neighborhood that was very convenient to everything we had planned. Robin sent detailed check-in info to me the morning of our arrival so I didn't have to follow up or reach out to her with questions. Everything listed in their posting is completely accurate. I highly recommend staying here!

9238563,107479524,2016-10-10,56355350,Barry,Steve and Robin's home is absolutely spotless! I had a wonderful stay from the moment I arrived. They have thought of everything and have gone above and beyond to make their guests comfortable. There is a private entrance to the home for easy access to come and go as you please. The bed is top notch and there is even a sauna in the bathroom. I am an Airbnb host myself and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home.

9238563,128161336,2017-01-22,50199314,Genie,Great place to stay! Nicely decorated and very comfortable. Great communication from the hosts yet private.
9238563,129410787,2017-01-30,73233123,Scott,"Highly recommended if your plans take you to Salem.

I had a very pleasant stay with Steve & Robin. Their space is very clean and spacious. I wish I would have made time to use the sauna! 

The bed is very comfortable and the home and neighborhood are quite. "
9238563,130703525,2017-02-07,95957287,Gregory,"Steve and Robin's place was perfect for our daughter's visit to Willamette University. The location was great and the place was spotless. Great communication with the hosts. Even though they were right above us, they were super quiet and not intrusive whatsoever. They provided plenty of linens, towels, blankets, and pillows. We were perfectly taken care of! We didn't get a chance to use the sauna, but it looked amazing. We enjoyed the coffee and oatmeal provided by the hosts. It was a great place to stay. We will definitely be back!"
9238563,131266060,2017-02-11,63651350,Nora,We used the space almost entirely for sleep between conference days and thus didn't take advantage of the sauna or patio. Well-lit stairs down to daylight basement. Met Robin briefly but didn't have time to talk. 
9238563,132070881,2017-02-15,22176227,Stacie,Great for our stay in Salem. Beautiful West Salem downstairs spot that was warm and inviting. We were lucky enough to be able to meet our hosts and were grateful for their dinning suggestions. Will definitely stay again if in the area!
9238563,132398670,2017-02-17,26915404,Ashley,"Steve and Robin were very friendly and accommodating, but when it came down to the sleeping hours the place was a little less than desirable primarily due to the pull out sofa bed. The mattress was so thin or old that you could see (and consequently feel) every spring. There was also no tv as advertised. All other details were fabulous, from the availability of soaps and shampoos to breakfast and coffee. They did have an ant problem though. It wasn't breakfast worth bragging about (frozen Jimmy dean egg sandwiches and packaged oatmeal. .which we mostly avoided) but the sentiment was there. The coffee was nice. The place was not as private as we had expected, so know that if you were to step outside, it is within view of the host and neighbors. That was fine for our situation, but if you're looking for a truly private affair this is likely not it. The host friendliness made it most worth it, but other than that I've stayed in finer establishments for this cost. I give them the high Stars for the friendliness in the communication and the effort (greetings messages, candy bowl, etc.) but the lack of comfort and privacy will not have me returning. "
9238563,132913454,2017-02-19,10332067,Galen,"Everything was so easy and all the details made us feel welcomed and so we'll taken care of. It's a very quiet neighborhood but still within minutes of city center.  We appreciated all the extras like breakfast items, bathroom toiletries, lots of extra pillows and blankets, and space heaters. Robin and Steve were always available for questions and very friendly. "
9238563,133123504,2017-02-20,95938675,Tonja,Steve greeted us upon arrival! Everything we needed to be comfortable for the night was provided.  Thanks so much Steve and Robin. 
9238563,133766880,2017-02-24,109184685,Deona,"Quiet, comfortable, private accommodations exactly as described.  Well-appointed and the sauna is very nice.  Super-clean.  Nice sheets, extra bedding.  Hosts helpful if needed but not intrusive.  Traveled to Salem for an interview and had a very nice trip.  Would definitely stay here again.  "
9238563,134536172,2017-02-27,84566947,Courtney,We had an amazing time staying at Steve and Robin's place! They were very warm and inviting and the sauna was a big plus! I would highly recommend this Air B&B location to everyone!

It is peaceful and quiet and feels like a home away from home. Lots of good food is a short trip away, too. 

All around, a very nice stay awaits you here."

Also perfectly situated not far from downtown so I could walk in in the mornings. Steve and Robin were very friendly as was their adorable little puppy and we would definitely stay here again!"
9238563,144105566,2017-04-14,34598159,Elizabeth,"Perfect for the traveler who values quiet and access to Willamette University and other downtown locations. 

The suite is as clean and well-equipped as a hotel (Website hidden by Airbnb) need to squabble over who gets the fold-out sleeper; it's as good as a regular bed thanks to the new foam mattress.

Steve and Robin (and their exuberant puppy) were on hand to greet us. After checkout, they alerted us right away when they saw we'd left an item in the suite. "
9238563,145565746,2017-04-18,4224984,Brendan,"When I travel to Salem for business, this is where I want to stay.  Steve and Robin are wonderful hosts.  The place is private, with easy check-in and check-out.  The unit is impeccable from the amenities and decor to the small thoughtful details."

9238563,146739811,2017-04-23,35064886,Amanda,This location was better then described! Steve and Robin go above and beyond to make their guess feel welcome. Beautiful private space that is comfortable and modern. The bedroom bathroom were well equipped and spacious: the living area was larger then expected and included a great patio area.

9238563,147593762,2017-04-27,47197792,Nick,Steve a Robin's place was perfect for my girlfriend and me. It was located close to some of the hikes we wanted to check out. Robin recommended Silver Falls and it didn't disappoint. There were also some quick breakfast items available which was a nice perk.

9238563,150852114,2017-05-09,45001573,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a night in early May 2017 with Steve & Robin. The space was great and was better than advertised. I feel like this is the kind of rental that makes AirBNB a wonderful platform.

Steve & Robin were so easy to communicate with leading up to our stay and we even had the pleasure of saying hi when we met them. Their space was wonderful, tons of open room and amenities. Quiet, incredibly comfortable, plus the hosts were kind enough to leave some breakfast snacks in the minifridge. Made staying there a breeze. Their location was super close to downtown, close to wineries, and close to outdoor parks.

I would highly recommend Steve & Robin to other travelers, and I would stay here again. Fantastic space and experience all around."
9238563,151407317,2017-05-12,1182888,Lynnette,Very well stocked with quality touches (the bed sheets were so soft!) The studio was very clean and spacious.

9238563,168622603,2017-07-09,134259544,Kara,"Steve and Robin have created a beautiful hideaway on their property. Our party flew in for a busy wedding weekend, and their little retreat met all of our needs and proved to be a calm and thoughtful balance to the chaos around us. If you stay you'll find a warm welcome and lovely attention to detail! It is easy to tell that inviting folks into their home is not only second nature, but also a joy to them. "

We had a spot in the driveway, any ammenity we could have hoped for, and plenty of space. This home is a residential area and removed from any hustle and bustle, but also a walk-able distance from Starbucks, groceries, and some other businesses. It was a very nice spot for a couple or small family!"

9238563,181358201,2017-08-12,116620970,Alana,Great hosts and great suite. Was easy to make safe for our active baby and for our 4 year old to be in. Best breakfast spread and coffee we have had yet in our Air BnB travels. Highly recommended for anyone but was a great place for our family of 4.

9238563,189714999,2017-09-02,65635589,Karissa,"We had a great time at Steve and Robin's. Our Job took us to the state fair for 10 days and it was great to have such a quiet private space to enjoy during the craziness of state fair. 

Our only mistake was not realizing how many stairs were involved to get in and out of the space. My roommate has trouble with  lots of stairs so in hindsight we should have found a place with minimal stairs. This was not the host's fault at all, they were wonderful, and the space itself was perfect!"

Located below and in back of their beautiful house, it has lots of light and a lovely patio outside, complete with a grill and seating.  There were lots of thoughtful touches included too (coffee, real cream, food treats, a nice steamer for wrinkled clothes) LOTS of space, great TV, great water pressure in shower, fluffy comforter and pillows, etc.   It is conveniently located to WU, shopping and easy access to our favorite hikes, wineries, etc.  Although we'd prefer to keep it a secret (so we can stay there often!) we give this space the highest of high recommendations for a stay in the Salem area.  It was perfect in every way.  And the bonus was meeting their cute little pooch, Anna!"

Steve and Robin were shortly in contact, sending me greetings and information about checking in. When I arrived, Robin came out and led me to the apartment, which is every bit as lovely as it appears in the photos.  Despite my last minute booking, my name was written on the welcome chalk board on the counter. There are a lot of special touches that make you feel welcome and cared for. In For a weary traveler such as myself the ultra comfortable bed is a definite plus!"

9238563,216422655,2017-12-03,18473729,Cory,"You will not regret booking this space. It is ultra clean, stylishly decorated, and very private. Steve and Robin set you up with everything you could need and are just a quick text away if you need anything else. The Sauna is the shining star of this space, so relaxing!

As soon as we walked in we had communication from our hosts on any questions we had and some treats they had left for us.

The space was just massive and extremely clean. There were many lovely extras (the sauna and breakfast burritos in the freezer) that we thought went above and beyond. The home is in a great neighborhood and a very short trip to downtown. We had dinner one night at Rafns', per their recommendation, and it was absolutely delicious. Five stars!"

9238563,260128053,2018-05-03,121576242,Robert,"Nice place. Just make sure you understand that this place only has one ""real"" bed and one pull-out bed. There's a tiny little couch thing that might work for a child or a Hobbit, but most adults would find it too small. Anyway, I just want to make sure that *you* pay attention to this, because *I* did not, and *I* had to sleep on the Hobbit bed.

Also note that it's essentially the basement of the house that Steve and Robin live in. It's easy to get to, and in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Salem is prettier than I realized.

I'd definitely stay there again."

9238563,264779648,2018-05-14,181682724,Thea,This was a great place to stay! Just on the other sided the river from downtown. All of the little touches that Robin and Steve have done to the space make it that much more enjoyable.

9238563,266914867,2018-05-20,7059327,Ami,"Steve & Robin are very communicative both through AirBnB and through text; we booked four days before the weekend, and they were responsive, and even recommended some wineries for our mini weekend getaway.

Steve & Robin's place is a cozy & cute downstairs level space. The room has a fireplace, which we didn't use. But, we did use the sauna, which was a lovely way to wind down after a day of meandering & wine tasting. 

I forgot to communicate that my partner is allergic to down, but they had a clear sign that pointed us to a non-down blanket! There are actually quite a few helpful signs around, and the folder of information is pretty detailed.

One last thing, you can hear the goings on of the floor above (mostly creaks and steps), so if you're a light sleeper or sensitive to sound, that might get to you. But we were fine with sharing a ceiling with the hosts!"
9238563,269720687,2018-05-27,86300508,Milo,Steve and Robins place was wonderful! They were outstanding hosts and made everything very easy. It was super clean and well stocked with snacks. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.

We would stay again if we come back to Salem!"

Beautiful touches and nice aromas invite you in, and little extras, like chocolates and quick breakfast items make you want to stay longer!

Chocolates, sparkling water, clean spaces, etc. They were also very responsive when the internet was down and helped us get re-connected! The only downside was morning noise- we woke up each morning around 7am because the noise from upstairs carries down to the rental space. Be aware of that when you book- still worth the booking, just a note... Also, their dog is adorable!"

The sauna was brilliant and everything was sparkling clean and even better than expected. Check in and parking were easy. There was even coffee and snacks provided.

Hope to come back and spend more time around the area."
9238563,485930486,2019-07-11,82279381,Gina,"Steve and Robin's home was a wonderful place to base our vacation out of.  They are very accommodating hosts and communication with them was easy and effortless.  The space in their home is comfortable with thoughtful little extra touches like chocolates and breakfast items in the refrigerator.  Little notes are clearly posted informing you of how things work in the home.  My daughters and I didn't spend a great deal of time in the space because we tend to make the very most of any vacation we take, but Steve and Robin's place was very welcoming to come back to after a day of hiking or sightseeing.  I will highly recommend their home to anyone I know who will be traveling to Salem."

9238563,606755453,2020-02-16,248987129,Micah,"A great small place. Tight road getting to their house. A short jaunt down a flight of stairs to a back entrance through some sliding glass doors. Very clean, modern, and enjoyable place to relax. The sauna was amazing! At the time of our stay there was only a microwave and kettle, no cooktop or convection oven so one would need to plan meals around that. The hosts are very kind and thoughtful! We arrived for a valentines weekend, and they had purchased a lovely rose for my wife!"
9238563,616536275,2020-03-09,95440094,Brittany,Lovely place and wonderful hosts. The bed is very comfortable and the sauna was such a nice feature. Would recommend for sure

The air-conditioning was a great touch as it was very hot when we stayed. Our dog enjoyed the yard and our daughter slept in a packnplay. The room is spacious and homey, with all the extras and more you would find at a luxury hotel. 

Leigh and her husband were nice to chat with on our way out and were perfect hosts! Great place to stay : )"
9477671,98553908,2016-08-31,47206221,Peg,"Leigh was very friendly and welcoming. The location was very convenient. She provided a delightful complimentary handmade bar of soap from a local store that I am still using. A nice stay, and I recommend as hosts to anyone!"
9477671,99106971,2016-09-03,90102129,Timothy,"We enjoyed our stay at Leigh's Boat House very much. After a long day of traveling, this was just what we needed to relax and unwind. Restaurants were in walking distance. After a nice dinner and a little walk back to the Boat House, we climbed into a cozy bed and slept well. This place had all we needed to be self sustained and private. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast recommendations very much, having come from out of town.
Thanks Leigh for your hospitality!"
9477671,99703480,2016-09-05,71321799,Kate,"Leigh was an awesome host, and we felt very well cared for, while still enjoying our privacy.

Very clean and comfortable with all amenities as described and beautifully decorated.  The cold beer & soda in the fridge were a very welcoming touch! I would definitely stay there again when I'm in Salem. 
9477671,102109059,2016-09-16,30482841,Brennan,"This place is simply amazing. From the welcoming and assistance of luggage, to the cold beers and quiet/tranquil backyard to enjoy once settled, Leigh & Robert have outdone themselves when it comes to hosting a private getaway in Salem. The Boat House has all the amenities for a short stay, within walking distance to convenient spots for eats/drinks. The accommodations are new, clean, comfortable, and welcoming. We slept the best of our travels during our adventures through Oregon, at this location. We appreciated the contemporary touches throughout, and private/quiet getaway when we wanted it. 

Be sure to take Leigh and Robert up on a convo, as the two of them have a fantastic past and are the friendliest of folks Oregon has to offer.

Well wishes, and sweet dreams!

Cheers,
B & B

9477671,103464777,2016-09-22,41675041,Lisa,"Leigh and Robert's guest house was very inviting, comfortable and in a great location to downtown Salem. Everything I needed was provided. Having the ability to check in late is a big plus as I didn't arrive until very late due to flight delays."
9477671,104199776,2016-09-25,400581,Scott,"Instructions, directions, and other information was sent nicely ahead of time and was super easy to follow. We arrived and were in the unit in short order getting unpacked and enjoying the beers they left for us in the fridge. 

Like another review says, ""dog-friendly"" is selling this short. More like dog-encouraging. The hosts love dogs and had fun playing with our furry friends. Our two little Boston Terriers LOVED running around the fully fenced yard. Little baggies and a waste bin were even provided. Inside were dog bowls and more. It truly is enthusiastically dog-friendly.

Overall, it's a quiet, comfortable, close to downtown, and run by the friendliest of hosts. It was really perfect for our long weekend in Salem.

Thank you!"
9477671,104972160,2016-09-29,29836932,Chris,Had such a good time. Will be back if it's available next time we are in town.
9477671,105382634,2016-10-01,86354411,Robert,"This was a wonderful experience!  Leigha and Robert were friendly, knowledgeable about the area and made solid restaurant recommendations.

We definitely plan on coming back!"
9477671,105724409,2016-10-02,48532984,Jennifer,Quick stay. Very nice house. Leigh ensured everything was ready upon my arrival. Will stay again!
9477671,107831979,2016-10-12,2553522,Val,"Leigh was very helpful and friendly throughout our short stay. We're considering moving to Salem and she shared helpful insights about Salem's historic neighborhoods, the community in general, & where to find good coffee houses. She very graciously allowed us to stay a couple of hours past checkout, which we really appreciated!

The convenient location is on a pleasant street filled with charming homes close to downtown. The accommodation is very private. We would be happy to stay there again."
9477671,109941693,2016-10-23,20887997,Bob,Very nice place and would be a nice little retreat

Thanks to Leigh for use of the camper and for accommodating our daughter  
We will return for a longer stay sometime."
9477671,111552793,2016-10-31,27412283,Margot,"The accommodations were clean, welcoming, and as described in the listing. The host communicated promptly and fully, and she even called us to see if we needed anything from the store. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, with the exception of moderate train horn noise in the early mornings.  We had plenty of hot water for showers. Bring fuzzy socks or slippers in the cooler months, as the concrete floors are a bit cold on bare feet."
9477671,112182209,2016-11-04,88686257,Frank,"Leigh was an absolutely wonderful host! The guest house is beautifully decorated, private and cozy.  Leigh was more than helpful with suggestions. She took the time to explain to two first time visitors to Oregon all the great places to check out.  If you are looking to roam the state of Oregon as we did, definitely check out Leigh's guest house in Salem. Leigh truly went way above and beyond to accommodate us and we could not have been happier. Can't recommend Leigh's guest house enough!  "
9477671,112619730,2016-11-06,99918324,Taunya,"We had a great time during our stay.  This place was really lovely, very clean, very stylish.  It was really nice to have Robert there waiting on the porch so we knew we were in the right spot!  The location was great, a very short distance to lots of different restaurants. They left things for our fur baby to use as well, which was very nice.  Bowls, towels, doggie cookies, a blanket.  Super nice and our pup loved it!  We would certainly stay here again.  Our pup was safe and happy and that made us relax and have a great time!"
9477671,113741158,2016-11-13,65256438,Anne,"Leigh and Robert welcomed us with open arms! If you're looking for a cute, clean, and private place to rest your head in an adorable neighborhood, look no further. Local beers in the mini fridge and handmade soap from
Salem were just a few of Leigh's personal touches. We had everything we needed and felt as though we were five minutes from everything in Salem. Thank you, Mrs. Leigh!"
9477671,115706607,2016-11-26,17569226,Jill,"The boat house is by far my favorite Airbnb stay so far.  Leigh was very helpful and accompanying.  The space itself is spacious and so comfortable.  She has literally thought of everything you might need.  We even had a few relatives stay in the cozy camper for a night.  I highly recommend booking the boat house, it was a peaceful quiet oasis during a busy family holiday."
9477671,116809732,2016-12-03,97418556,Nolan,Fantastic stay at the boat house. Would stay here again! We loved it and they were very accommodating of our dogs.
9477671,117052552,2016-12-04,2362065,Noah,"I can't say enough good things about this place. The guest house is beautifully designed and immaculately clean. Leigh really puts love into it.  She was a warm + welcoming host, and thought through all the details (detailed check-in instructions, beer in the fridge, etc). It offers beyond hotel-quality amenities with loads of personal charm. This is a great find and the place to stay if you're in Salem. "
9477671,120464809,2016-12-10,24276223,Chris,Great place with lots of thoughtful touches we live in town locally and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again . 
9477671,123536626,2016-12-29,6245485,Robin,"The space was super unique and clean.  The concrete floors are a cool unique vibe, though admittedly cold in the winter.  "
9477671,124393508,2017-01-01,46428056,Steve,"This place is dog friendly, clean, quiet, in a private back yard, and has a very comfortable pillow top bed. Lots of nice touches made for a relaxing stay. Leigh is a fount of local information. We would stay again."
9477671,126680047,2017-01-13,33513181,Travis,This place worked great for my visit and certainly for my dog.  Leigha is very accommodating and kind.
9477671,127058433,2017-01-15,65895478,Kelly,"We loved staying at this adorable AirBNB. Leigh was super friendly and helpful... she was incredibly easy to communicate with before and during our stay. Parking was easy (Even for big vehicles... I borrowed an SUV from a family member as it was snowy, and had plenty of space to parallel park in front of the house - would have been even easier with my usual small car). The place is quirky, cute and comfortable, with a open floor plan and calming color palette. We didn't bring our dogs, but this is a great place to do so as the yard is fenced in and there are spots outside to sit. The location is convenient- about 5 minutes from downtown Salem and 20 minutes from local Vineyards, in a quiet neighborhood. "

9477671,141771476,2017-04-04,27323344,Dailing,My stay at Leigh's place was amazing! She was great with communication before and during my stay and her house manual was very helpful for any questions I had. The place is extremely clean and very cozy and is much more charming in person that the photos can show. I didn't have any trouble finding parking and was able to get a spot right out front. The yard was great for my pup to do her business - she even provided dog bags for picking up. My stay was short but was able to find food very easily and quickly. I had a wonderful time at Leigh's and would definitely stay there again. I highly recommend it!
9477671,141941879,2017-04-05,65993741,Wingky,"Wonderful place to stay! We have 4 pups and Leigh was very kind and let us stay with them. Beautiful cottage,  fenced in yard, close to town and I5. No TV though but there is wifi, bring your own entertainments! We would definitely stay with her again."

9477671,142319437,2017-04-07,45542484,Peter,"This place is just perfect.  You walk through a side gate behind a cute craftsman house in a nice quiet neighborhood, and step to a little shed in the backyard, but upon opening the door, you find yourself in a super clean little oasis...artfully decorated and with everything you need for a comfortable and luxurious stay.

If you're lucky, you might even get to know some of Leigha's helpful neighbors, one of whom helped me out with advice on many things as I waited to check in.

Our kid might end up attending college in Salem so we might get more opportunities to stay here...and really look forward to that."
9477671,142969274,2017-04-09,71934698,Gleneva,"This was an awesome place. Everything was clean, comfortable, inviting, and friendly. I highy recommend staying here!

Just what we were looking for! Thankyou! "

There is no TV, which was perfect for me but there is great wifi. The bed was ultra comfortable, the beers and chilled glasses in the fridge were a nice touch and Leigh was very accommodating about my reservation changes before and during my stay there. I would definitely stay there again!"
9477671,149122171,2017-05-02,107497330,Johanna,Leigh and Robert were warm and kind and laid back. Very personable and communicative and helpful when needed. The boathouse was private and quiet and served our needs perfectly. What a pretty neighbourhood too.

9477671,154664916,2017-05-25,54513618,October,Leigh was super friendly! We enjoyed the space and found it fit our needs perfectly. It was about a ~20 minute walk from downtown Salem and had a coffee shop about 10 minutes away.
9477671,156462081,2017-05-30,13780445,Will,"I don't know where to start nor end!

The guesthouse and its amenities are as advertised, and by ""as advertised"" I mean incredible while also being tastefully decorated.

The location couldn't be better for visiting the great public parks, wonderful wineries, and everything downtown Salem has to offer.

Leigh is without a doubt the best host on airbnb PERIOD and she has thought of everything down the the finest detail that a guest could want or need.

Additionally, she's one of those people you come across in life that you can talk to for hours on end while only thinking mere minutes have passed AKA never met a stranger.

My wife and I were so happy to have found this gem and Leigh is welcome to stay in our home anytime should she find herself in Atlanta, GA!

9477671,176785771,2017-07-31,23773822,Scott,"Great place exactly as advertised. The hosts are very friendly and knowledgeable regarding Salem and Oregon in general.

9477671,185836034,2017-08-22,16583972,Barbara,"This was a charming, light filled space in a quiet residential part of Salem.  Leigh was very helpful in answering questions as we were to be there for the eclipse, with my daughter and 10 month old granddaughter.  We had a wonderful time and enjoyed hanging out in the large yard, with comfortable chairs.  All details of supplies, fresh coffee, etc had been thoughtfully arranged.  I would very strongly recommend this as a pleasant retreat space!  
It's usual price is quite reasonable but of course for the eclipse all prices were elevated."

She has carefully considered every aspect of making her guests feel comfortable and welcome. The Boathouse is open, has a great design aesthetic, and invites guests to linger and enjoy the comfortable space. Leigh offered some great suggestions for area attractions and we even changed our plans to check out a couple of her suggestions. WE loved our stay, and know that this will be our ""go-to"" place when we return to Salem! We cannot wait to stay again!"
9477671,188549993,2017-08-29,59500042,Marinella,Leigha and Robert are amazing people. I felt an immediate connection to them both. There home is a cozy comfortable safe private space.

Every detail of the home was thoughtful and considered, both the practical (beautiful hand towels laid out next to the sink; foam pillows on the bed) and the stylish (the rake mug holder by the sink is an idea I'm planning to steal for our house!) and Leigh & Robert couldn't have been more helpful if they tried.

Love that it is pet-friendly, even though I did not bring a pet this time, it is a great place for pets.  Quiet, great location, super-comfy bed.  Hosts are quickly responsive, informative and available."

When I arrived, Leigh met me and promptly showed me the space (including two beers and chilled glasses in the mini fridge)! She made sure to introduce her beautiful dog as well, so I would not be alarmed if I found him in the yard. I was busy all week and mostly spent my evenings in the house, but it was a perfect space to recharge. If you want a stylish place close to downtown with really communicative hosts, look no further."

Very sweet, docile big dog. Our border collie loved the large yard to roam. If we were to stay in Salem again, we would definitely stay at Leigh's place."
9477671,226621348,2018-01-11,14543703,Vanessa,A wonderful and cute house! I would recommend this for anyone traveling for business as I do. It was a great place to relax and unwind!

9477671,229014468,2018-01-21,71163913,Josh,"The space is a quaint little detached garage-turned guest house.  It is cozy, clean, and comfortable and only about a 5 minute drive to downtown.  The hosts are clearly animal/dog lovers and that makes a huge difference when traveling with your pet."

9477671,238435977,2018-02-25,6040038,Tigerlily,"The boat house was really lovely. We were just looking for a place to crash over night and ended up having a really sweet get away feeling because of all of the details Leigh has included. Heated sheets, soft towels, dog treats and even a beverage for the weary traveler. Thank you!"
9477671,241859617,2018-03-10,64093472,Alexandra,What a nice place to stay in the heart of Salem. It was not only a beautiful and comfortable space but Leigh was fantastic.

9477671,243109528,2018-03-14,10639664,Jim,"Super clean, great shower and an electric blanket!  Nice and quiet too - the rain on the metal roof helped me sleep like a baby.  Did I mention the electric blanket?"
9477671,243624771,2018-03-16,22007864,Lauren,"Leigh's guest house was amazing! One of the nicest guest houses we've stayed at using Airbnb.  There were many thoughtful touches throughout the guest house, the yard was great for our dog, and Leigh was friendly and accessible.  We'll be back!"
9477671,244533520,2018-03-18,111677587,Kathy,"This is a great place to stay. It was easy to get to restaurants and other activities in town, but was comfortably secluded for privacy. Wonderfully supplied to meet our needs."

Sage & Polly"
9477671,245782577,2018-03-23,12911502,Rachel,"Leigh was so accommodating. I had to book this place last minute due to a family emergency. After one night my plans changed and i had to alter my dates, and Leigh was so understanding and helpful. Most importantly, the space is just gorgeous! Everything from the ginger ale in the fridge to the heated beds were carefully thought out by Leigh to make the space warm (literally) and inviting. I have been raving about the space to my family in the area!"
9477671,246097071,2018-03-24,27762248,Garrett,Immaculately clean with a lovely private space.
9477671,246984787,2018-03-26,25698217,Chris,"Leigh's place was absolutely perfect for my wife and I. It's a small and cozy studio, but still has plenty of room to move around. You can tell Leigh put a lot of thought into making the space comfortable and stylish. The shower pressure was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable!

Downtown Salem doesn't have much to offer, though it is growing, so we used the location as a center point for our day trips to the coast (Pacific City) and to a waterfall hike to the east (Abiqua Falls). I would definitely book this space again."
9477671,247524335,2018-03-28,33610106,Ernesto,This is place is perfect for the couple who are traveling and need a great place to sleep. My wife and I drove from Southern CA to Vancouver BC and were on the road all day. We booked Leigh's place a few hours before getting there. She responded quickly and the place was ready for us when we arrived late in the evening. The place was cozy and the heater turned on so the place was warm when we arrived. The highlight was the heated bed!  It was the best night sleep of our 6 day road trip! We definitely would stay there again.
9477671,247810297,2018-03-29,116434752,Miki,"Much more than we expected!

Be sure to check out the drawers of the table. There are all sorts of helpful info about Salem. 

We will definitely be back!"
9477671,251897271,2018-04-08,36234374,Mary,"Very comfortable, private space. I liked the special touches.

She was the perfect host!"
9477671,252707530,2018-04-11,6165892,Eileen,"We had a great one night stay here with our dog. The yard was great and perfect for our dog to run around after our long drive stuck in the car all day! 

The place was nicely decorated and clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Leigh was very friendly and helpful if we needed anything. 

Thanks again for having us!"

Their place is wonderful and cozy, private and comfortable. They had numerous suggestions for us for wineries, restaurants and activities, all of them were spot on. We are definitely staying again next time we are anywhere near Salem."

9477671,264804037,2018-05-14,18977340,Terrence,"This is a great AirBnb! Exactly the reason we choose these types of properties over a hotel room. Very clean, cute space with everything we needed for a great weekend in Salem. Great host.  Highly recommend this spot!"
9477671,265949292,2018-05-18,93208954,Miranda,"I loved this place. Clean, nice, and super comfy. I loved the hosts. Also, bonus points for their super sweet dog. All the attention to detail and thoughtful amenities made it the perfect place to relax after a long day. The bed and the sheets were outstanding! Definitely the best AirBnb I have stayed in."
9477671,267798700,2018-05-22,66449356,Sue,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this charming boathouse.  The space included so many fun and helpful details; it was obvious the hosts went out of their way to make guests comfortable.  The bed was super comfortable and the decor very stylish and interesting.  We also enjoyed sitting outside in their lovely back yard. Hosts were friendly, fun and very helpful.  I highly recommend."

9477671,270307516,2018-05-28,4440100,Rebecca,Leigh's home was lovely!  The house was much bigger then it looks in pictures and very comfortable. Leigh and her husband were very kind and helpful. 
9477671,271592118,2018-06-01,34006181,Ashley,"This place is so cute and cozy! Central location is nice - we were in town for my brothers graduation just south in Lebanon, OR but wanted to explore Portland as well.

Leigh communicates so quickly! This was a huge blessing as we changed our dates last minute to stay our final night right by the Portland airport to catch an early flight. 

The bed is SO comfy! We had a very peaceful nights rest. The decor is very farmhouse (which we LOVE). 

We would definitely come back to stay again! 

Thanks!"
9477671,273044191,2018-06-04,21822866,Julie Anne,This was a wonderful place to have as a home base for our Silver Falls trip. Leigh and her husband are super friendly and went out of their way to help (even lent my friend a pair of shoes!). The space was immaculate and well-designed. Their pupper is the cutest and the backyard is charming. We had everything we needed. I would stay here again if ever back in Salem!
9477671,273344504,2018-06-05,7001575,Lauren,"A wonderful place to stay! The bed was AMAZING first off. It’s the little details that matter to us as we travel often and stay in hotels weekly. Just a few details we loved: the locally made hand soap that smelled of lavender, the fire pit and wood provided, the small dog bed for any pet you may bring, and the coffee and teas provided were all such lovely touches. We will definitely be back:)"
9477671,274268823,2018-06-08,92847672,Kevin,"Great place.
Excellent host."
9477671,274643581,2018-06-09,134264402,Adam,This is a lovely little place in a quiet neighborhood.  It was raining much of the time we were there (just one night) but if the weather was better you could walk downtown (about a mile) to various bars and restaurants. Leigh is a great host and loves your dogs!  We met her Great Dane and he was super cute as well!
9477671,275807512,2018-06-11,29951775,Myron,"What a great place to stay. Leigh was in constant communication and gave us some great tips to make our hike to Abiqua Falls as seamless as possible. She was so nice to us and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Her place was perfect to come home to after a long exhausting day of hiking, set just right for some relaxing. Thanks for the hospitality Leigh! "
9477671,276405633,2018-06-13,119135383,Nicholas,"Perfectly positioned in Salem.  The neighborhood is quaint and quiet.  Leigh and her husband are great hosts, welcoming and helpful, but respect your privacy.  The Urban Boathouse is adorable, immaculate, spacious, and well appointed."

9477671,277561045,2018-06-16,131457612,Andrew,Leigh's place is in a great part of Salem. It's really close to a cool part of town with good restaurants and bars but it's far enough away that it is really quiet at night. It was clean and very comfortable. 
9477671,278337403,2018-06-17,45572871,Sarah,Beautiful space and great hosts!
9477671,283391450,2018-06-29,119135383,Nicholas,"Leigh and her husband are fantastic hosts!  This is my second stay at their Urban Boathouse and I am already looking to book my third.  This time I had my dog with me and it worked out beautifully.  Usually, my pup is a bit anxious at a new spot, but by the second day, she was relaxed and secure in her surroundings.  I could not ask for my gracious and responsive hosts!  See you both soon."
9477671,300702513,2018-08-02,74263808,Cris,Absolutely worth every single penny! Hands down better than any hotel in the area.

9477671,305051631,2018-08-10,49768305,Roy,"Super clean, comfortable space fused with spectacular hosting-craft.  IMMACULATELY CLEAN, they must somehow autoclave the entire unit between guests.  Soft sheets, chilled glasses, fancy (Website hidden by Airbnb) many neat, unexpected, welcome touches after a long bike ride up The Willamette.

And it’s not just the comforting physical space:  Ryder, Leigh, and Robert’s natural quirky welcoming vibe made us feel like we were not visitors.  For three days, We Were Home.  

Recommend you throw the fuzzy pineapple to Ryder a few times, stroll the friendly neighborhood, and try a cool local wine or coffee on the patio next to the vintage travel-trailer.  Robert, Leigh, and Ryder have many insightful ideas how to enjoy Salem and The Willamette."
9477671,306600664,2018-08-12,29600342,Andy,"Very well appointed house, even nicer than as presented on the site which is rare. Checking in and out was a breeze. Highly appreciate houses that are dog friendly but so clean you aren’t sure if a dog’s ever stayed there before. "

The guest house was very clean and the bed was so soft and comfortable! There is not a kitchen, but a coffee maker is provided, which was all we needed since we were only visiting for a day. Thoughtful touches include local craft beer in the fridge and a perfectly placed full length mirror. This house is close to downtown, too! There are train tracks nearby and we heard one train at night, so be aware if you're a light sleeper. This was a lovely space for our short and sweet visit to Salem. I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Salem!"

But relishing in conversations and music, by the fire pit, or inside enjoying the coffee and provided beers/Hansen's, you can't beat it. Love it. WE'll be back next time in Salem."
9477671,346727098,2018-11-09,130044067,Luba,"Leigh and Robert were great hosts. Very warm and welcoming. The fenced in backyard was perfect for our puppy. Leigh's dog Ryder was very well bahaved and played well with our pup. Anything we needed Leigh was more than happy to help with. The fire pit was a great touch and let us enjoy ourselves in the evenings. Definitely recommend if you have a pup of your own and want a laid back stay!

Thank you guys!

No problems upon arrival and  was pleasantly surprise by all the simple details. Very cool space I felt like I was in a fancy little hotel room. Minimalist yet every touch thought out. No TV not and wasn’t an issue when you’re feeling romantic and have amazing food recommendations of going to Christo’s. Truly a great staycation for anyone. Not a place to take long showers  but everything was very nice."

9477671,410757427,2019-02-10,4131637,Timothy,"Excellent location, great cottage, exceptionally cool hosts - overall an A+ Airbnb experience. Leigh was attentive and easy to talk to. We were traveling through Salem gathering intel on the city (we hope to relocate to Oregon in the future) and the surrounding areas. Leigh popped over and provided some useful insider info, as well as good company in general. Definitely the place to stay."
9477671,412110931,2019-02-14,141424048,James,Leigh’s place is great! She provided an excellent local tip for cuisine as well :) Wonderful place to stay.
9477671,412510311,2019-02-15,97713683,Leann,Our stay was great! It was even more stylish in person and there were lots of thoughtful small touches. It was great to stay in a place with our pup and to have our own space separate space. I LOVED the shower head (want to get one for myself!) and loved having a heated blanket on the bed for use. My only tip to future visitors is to wear your socks in the winter- the floors get chilly! 
9477671,412915483,2019-02-16,173287726,Matt,This cozy guest house will be a home away from home. The boat house has such cozy features and is quite stylish. My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the living space and the hospitality of the host. The location too is perfect for getting around Salem. Highly recommend staying here when in Salem.
9477671,414174652,2019-02-18,3859828,Alexa,"Wonderful location! This is a beautiful space that's centrally located. The home has so many intentional details. She and her husband even included cold beverages like La Criox in the fridge - it warms my hipster millennial heart. We really found the space to be comfortable, convenient and easy to access. The check-in and overall communication was top notch. I would highly recommend Leigh's boathouse to anyone looking for a comfortable space in the Salem area."

9477671,417933732,2019-02-28,156377177,Michelle,"Staying at the boat house was great! My boyfriend and I are planning to move to Salem and needed a reasonably priced place to stay for 2 nights to look for apartments. The location was right in the middle of everywhere we needed to go. The place was charming with a separate enterance. Leigh was very quick with all responses. She greeted as we arrived a few minutes early with Ryder (he is adorable) to make sure we got settled. She was very personable and made sure to give us pointers on food and areas to check out. It was very cold out and she even turned on the heater for us. The place was clean, the bed comfy, and had everything we needed. As others mentioned, your showers need to be quick due to hot water running out, but Leigh mentions that in the instructions and it didn't bother us much. Overall it was a great way to be greeted in Salem and we would definitely recommend!"
9477671,419401211,2019-03-03,21024127,Randi,"Unbelievable bed as many reviewers mentioned! Loved the rain shower and bathroom.

9477671,439331683,2019-04-18,42994179,Kevin,"This was the first road-trip with my pup. We used a few Airbnb’s along the way, and this was *by far* the best. Some places “accept” dogs (with fees), but this place is dog centric, and one of the few places my dog actually felt comfortable in. The boat house is awesome. Great amenities. Great hosts. Can’t say enough."

Me and my family had a great stay and with it being close to the riverfront for a concert we were attending and in a nice, quiet neighborhood it made for a comfortable and convenient stay. The home was really nice and very clean and they have done a great job with it as a whole. Having a fully fenced yard for our dog was awesome and I felt very comfortable walking him around the neighborhood as well. Although not advertised as suitable for kids it was just fine for us who have a baby who's not very mobile yet. There was plenty of room for a pack and play. We'd definitely stay again if we end up coming back to Salem and are in need of a place to stay."

Private entry and space, cute touches (the fire-simulated heater is super neat), cozy, no TV (which is a plus, in my book!), had everything we could have needed or forgot at home, and a convenient location for our travel purposes.  Only downside is that the hot water only lasts 10 minutes or so before needing to reset, so showers were slightly hurried, but that wasn't enough to make this anything less than a 10/10."

9477671,635755253,2020-07-07,55946423,Liane,Probably one of the best AirBnbs I have ever stayed at. The place was cute and quirky with stylish design features on the inside. Leigh and Robert have done an amazing job of creating a space that emulates the best parts of Oregon and just makes you want to hang out inside –– or outside on the lawn–– all day. They were incredibly friendly and giving and had great advice for activities and food. The neighborhood is also very cool and the neighbors are very friendly. Only a 20-minute walk from downtown. Leigh recommended we check out the farmer's market and we were so glad that we did. 100% recommend this wonderful AirBnb experience.
9477671,636543063,2020-07-10,694085,Davis,Leigh's place was a great place to stay for the night on our Pacific Northwest road trip.  It's a very nice and thoughtfully decorated cottage situated in the backyard of their home.  Leigh was very helpful in getting us checked in and providing some tips for Salem and the neighborhood.  We also enjoyed sitting out in the backyard with some complementary drinks she provided.
9477671,638232737,2020-07-14,17368578,Virginia,"Nice clean quiet space in pretty neighborhood, close to everything & nice to just walk around the area & (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy bed, very clean. Nice fenced yard for my dogs to just be let out for their morning constitutional without concern. -- I feel I should mention the train, though, in case that's not just temporary. (I'm hoping Leigh will comment on this, if I'm wrong.) The place is near enough the train tracks that the (prolonged) 3am whistle/horn as it comes through town can be clearly heard & woke me both nights. Just FYI, if you're a light sleeper.  Otherwise, great."
9477671,638793692,2020-07-16,229521588,Aja,"Super comfortable little place. Lovely neighborhood, quiet space. Easy to find and easy check in. The space was clean and the amenities made it feel homey.

9477671,653926730,2020-08-20,137916270,Ana,Stylish boat house in the backyard! Close to downtown Salem and local eateries. We loved biking around downtown. Comfortable bed and amenities.
9477671,656128264,2020-08-24,3537477,Brian,"Leigh is a Superhost among Superhosts! Her place is sparking clean, very private, very well appointed and a spectacular value for the comfort and convenience provided by the Boat House in Salem. Bed was big and cozy, rain shower was awesome, back yard was perfect for us and our dog, and as a bonus her majestic great dane Rider got along fine with our 14 year old grumpy border collie :D
Leigh left us to our own when we wanted privacy, but make herself available for advice on local restaurants, wineries and parks. Place is perfectly situated for bike rides and walks to local coffee shops and restaurants, and is a short drive from beautiful Oregon Wine Country.
Leigh takes COVID preparation very seriously, and all precautions were taken -- we felt very safe and taken care of staying at her place for the weekend.
You'd be hard pressed to find a nicer place in the Salem area. If you're road-tripping north or south through Oregon and want to take a peaceful break, this is where you want to be!"

As for the tiny house, it was immaculate, spacious, and very comfortable! Everything from the bed, to the extra cleaning amenities, to the outside sitting area was perfect for our short stay. Thank you Leigh and family!"

The house is super cute, very clean, and cozy. Overall very comfortable, and Leigh has all the right touches to make it feel like home. We would definitely stay here again!"
9477671,700678328,2020-10-15,2724460,Ann,"Clean, comfortable and safe.  The bed was equal to a four star hotel!  The shower is great.  Overall a great value and we recommend highly."
9477671,701812620,2020-10-18,13320321,Jacob,"Stylish space in a very cool neighborhood. Space was clean, check in/check out was very easy, and amenities were exactly as advertised."
9477671,702384002,2020-10-20,116630120,Sarah,"Lovely space, perfect for what we were looking for. Would definitely stay again."
9597053,58694054,2016-01-03,39200948,Cornelius,"10/10 experience! Karen respected our privacy, knew we weren't from around there and showed us things to do! Was a very amazing host! "
9597053,59724613,2016-01-14,8446168,Kristin,"Karen is such a wonderful host.  The place is beautiful and she makes it very personal and warm with snacks, tea, and even breakfast for the morning.  It was a pleasure staying with her."
9597053,59943792,2016-01-17,21616609,Beth,"Karen was a wonderful host. I could not have asked for a better first time Airbnb experience. The apartment is adorable, well-stocked and close to downtown Salem. It has everything one would need for a short or long stay."
9597053,60223505,2016-01-20,53374511,Cambria,Karen was an absolutely wonderful host! She immediately made us feel welcome and her overall hospitality was so genuine. The accommodations were above and beyond what we expected. We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay with Karen!
9597053,60849450,2016-01-28,8446168,Kristin,Karen was amazing as always!  She even mailed back my ipad charger.  I am so grateful for all she does when I come stay.
9597053,61487865,2016-02-05,6063586,Barbara,"Karen was very easy to communicate with, and everything was ready for us even though Karen was preparing to go out of the country.  The apartment was cozy and homey, and the kitchen was great to cook in, with nice knives, pans, etc.  The only drawback -- and Karen said she'd fix this -- was the lack of a decent reading lamp in either the living room or bedroom.  Otherwise all was as the listing described, we would stay here again."
9597053,70064430,2016-04-15,25683636,Aaron,Karen is the most attentive and caring host. She went above and beyond helping myself and my girlfriend out our last week  b/c of our jobs and can't give enough thanks. She is very informative of the area and if you are looking for something to do she can help. The home is very cute and clean and has everything and more you can ask for. Very quiet neighborhood that is close to everything and on a sunny day a very nice walk to down town. We have booked more time with Karen in her historic home and look forward to it. Highly recommend! 
9597053,70334526,2016-04-17,10526217,Selena,"We loved our stay at Karen's place. Though Karen was out of town and we didn't have the chance to meet, she was easily available by text message and let us know everything we needed to have a comfortable stay.  Knowing that we were bringing our sons (two years old and newborn), Karen thoughtfully left a high chair and toddler dishes in the kitchen for our use.  The location was perfect for us.  It's within a mile of Riverfront Park and stops and restaurants downtown.  We spent a lot of time at Riverfront Park, walking on the paths, playing on the playground, and riding the carousel.  We were very comfortable during our stay -- I think we all actually slept better than we do at home!  We'll definitely return if we're in Salem again."
9597053,71160158,2016-04-24,15620609,Carolyn,Karen was a great host. She met us and helped us settle in. She lives in an apt upstairs and the kitchen in our apt was fully stocked. Turns out this was great for me since I needed to make a soup for Passover for my step- daughter at Willamette U. We had a great time!
9597053,73706310,2016-05-09,25683636,Aaron,"We love staying with Karen and hated to leave. She went above and beyond as a host to make sure we were comfortable and to help with all of our things. She has the kindest spirit and warmest heart. We hope, by chance, that we get to stay with her again before our travels take us else where. "
9597053,73805455,2016-05-10,43983635,Mariesa,"Karen was welcoming, and very professional. She greeted us when we arrived and she also got in contact with me before we arrived so that everything went smooth. She also helped us find a great hiking spot where we had one of the best hikes of our trip. The house was spacious, clean, and honestly felt like a real home, not just somewhere we were staying. It was close to stores and to downtown Salem so the location was perfect. "
9597053,74700236,2016-05-16,42923982,Miya,"Karen's home was just the perfect spot for my husband, daughter and myself to stay while attending our son's graduation from Willamette.  The location was convenient, near downtown and the college but in its own quiet neighborhood.  The house was well appointed with everything we might need.  Karen was a welcoming host, available if we needed her, but discreet and non-intrusive.  Her historic home is comfortable and full of interesting antique items.  Highly recommended."
9597053,75859851,2016-05-23,59395569,Joyce,"Due to three different flight schedules -- arriving and departing -- and an itinerary devoted to all-day field trips, my party didn't actually spend much time in Karen's very comfortable home.

Clean and tidy, cozy and well-appointed, all was as advertised. The  location proved a convenient ""home base"" for our travels, and we particularly appreciated the peaceful neighborhood at the end of the day.

Karen promptly answered all questions posed prior to our arrival, and provided contact information in case we had questions or concerns once we'd settled in.

I'd re-visit this listing -- two thumbs up!"
9597053,76481138,2016-05-27,21566972,Colleen,What a beautiful home and warm welcome!  Thanks so much to Karen for the care she took during our stay. We had strange arrival hours and she was so accommodating and communicative.  We loved her beautiful home and will definitely reach out when we return to Salem!
9597053,77125775,2016-05-30,1854059,Mandi,"Karen was such a gracious hostess! Her home is lovely, the photos don't do it justice, and we had a fabulous weekend in Salem! Can't recommend her place highly enough - great location, quiet neighborhood and historic but comfy accommodations. "
9597053,77744360,2016-06-03,52254765,Jennifer,Karen was great. We had great privacy and very cozy
9597053,78128285,2016-06-05,18928677,Lori,"This is a great location for stores because things were in walking distance. Very quiet at night, and roomy for us. Loved it!"
9597053,79135159,2016-06-11,3481989,Amber,Very spacious and cute. Loved the location.
9597053,81003797,2016-06-20,59836996,Sandy,"Great location, very quiet. Karen is all about making your stay easy. Would definitely stay in her home again."
9597053,81532988,2016-06-23,48272447,Cathy,Thank you Karen for a very comfortable stay.  Everyone we needed was there.  Very clean and neat.  We really appreciated you invitation to use the food in your refrigerator.   We used some oatmeal and left you a jar of peanut butter.  We felt right at home.
9597053,82416050,2016-06-27,61275789,Melissa,We had a brief but very lovely stay in Salem. Karen was kind and hospitable and the room was great. We had plenty of space and the home was beautiful and charming. We plan to go back to Oregon for a longer stay. I absolutely recommend staying with Karen!!
9597053,84117965,2016-07-05,464908,Kathleen,"Very enjoyable location to enjoy Salem over the July 4th weekend.  Clean, comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood."
9597053,84802744,2016-07-09,22326054,Susie,"Thank you for opening your home to us, Karen.  It was comfortable & suited the needs of our traveling group (2 adults, 2 children) well.  The kitchen was large & well-appointed and use of the grill outside was a plus!  Viewing a deer grazing a short distance from the kitchen window the first morning was delightful.  And the grand-kids especially thank you for the delicious cookies and popsicles awaiting them.  :)     Being so close to all we wanted to see and do in Salem, it was perfect.   Thanks, again!
"
9597053,85233822,2016-07-10,31042691,Sarah,"Our stay in Karen's apartment was great, though too short. The apartment was very comfortable and well-supplied. We had a chance to meet Karen when we checked in and she showed us around. She was kind and helpful and even had everything ready for us early since we had a wedding to attend that evening. We were so grateful, and would definitely recommend staying here during a trip to or through Salem. "
9597053,86117238,2016-07-15,65904634,Michael,"My stay at Karen's place felt like ""home away from home"". Many thanks for the thoughtful bouquets of flowers (hydrangea and roses) as well as all the amenities in the kitchen. I highly recommend Karen's home for the Salem traveler."
9597053,86853266,2016-07-17,47208724,Doug,"Karen's place was great. The house was very nice, we had the whole downstairs our selves. the space is separate from the upstairs living area. The decor was nice, the place was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The house was located very close to the downtown area and was easy access to were we needed to be. The price was very reasonable, if I need to stay in Salem again I would book Karen's again in heart beat. "
9597053,88541150,2016-07-24,68457285,Kat,We had a wonderful stay in Salem. The place was pretty much as we expected. It was very comfortable with lots of amenities. Thank you!
9597053,91076481,2016-08-03,10477353,Laura,"I can't say enough good things about Karen's place. A big attractive space, well located in Salem, very comfortable. It was perfect for us - just a couple blocks away from Ideabox, the prefab home builder, that we wanted to visit.

Karen was very helpful with directions and information, super sweet. Great hospitality.

Wonderful space in Salem and a super value - will stay here again when in Oregon, definitely."
9597053,92164850,2016-08-07,57189464,Emily,"Of all of my trips, this was the certainly best Airbnb experience I've had so far. Karen was absolutely amazing!  My friends and I came into town just a few hours before a wedding and Karen provided us with everything we needed and more (food, an iron, etc.). She even brought down fresh baked cookies for us. And though we had planned on walking to town the next day (which is very close), she insisted on driving us. I've never had a more generous host. In addition, Karen's home is perfectly placed close to town, but in a quiet neighborhood so you can expect to have a relaxing stay. In all, I would highly recommend staying here if you find yourself visiting Salem. Thanks Karen! "
9597053,94143290,2016-08-14,3774452,Blanca,"Karen was a great host. She was there to welcome us, and explained everything about the apartment. The apartment was clean and the bed & coach were comfortable. Thanks for everything we had a great time at your place."
9597053,95325812,2016-08-19,18160046,Shannon,"We loved everything about Karen's Airbnb. It was clean, large space and felt like home. Great location to downtown Salem. She left goodies in the fridge and around for us to eat which is above and beyond kind. She was very genuine and kind when we bumped into her coming and going! Would tell a friend to stay here!!"
9597053,96132833,2016-08-21,16021463,Moon,See previous comments. 
9597053,97789031,2016-08-28,8138033,Barbi,"Karen's place was even better than I imagined. ! Loved having a full kitchen with oven plus a big dining table in a seperate area . 
Everything felt clean and cosy and like home . Didn't have time to make the most of the big TV and read all the current magazines .
Will have to stay longer next time !"
9597053,99743684,2016-09-05,1718013,Carly,"Was in town for a wedding so basically only slept at Karen's place but she was very helpful, and the house was comfortable. Beautiful fresh flowers in several of the rooms was a sweet treat! Didn't do much sightseeing but the location wasn't far from downtown Salem."
9597053,101036248,2016-09-11,38166565,Rhonda,"Karen was wonderful and very accommodating.  Her place was clean, quiet and perfect for what we needed. I would definitely stay here again."

The accommodations were lovely, comfortable, and very well taken care of.  My first Airbnb experience made me want to try my next and definitely come back."
9597053,102867419,2016-09-19,49346423,Amanda,"Thank you Karen for a wonderful stay!  The house was beautiful and peaceful.  We were able to spread out and eat our own food, thanks to the full kitchen.  We appreciated all the hosting and the amenities.  Would stay again!"
9597053,104368220,2016-09-26,73367205,Joe,The place was exactly as shown. Karen greeted us with keys to get our vacation started. We were there with a planned vacation but she offered any help or ideas if we needed them. It was an easy location in regards to traveling the different wine regions
9597053,104856377,2016-09-28,16375430,Andrew,"We really enjoyed our stay at Karen's place! It was clean, quiet, and plenty of space for us and our three year old. She even provided toys to play with which were a huge hit!"
9597053,105811267,2016-10-03,20991398,Dan,Karen has a very cute house and really took care of us.  We had a totally flawless time and would gladly stay again with her.

9597053,109620043,2016-10-22,2995642,James And Seong,"Karen's house was perfect for my needs.  Tidy and well kept house with lots of lounging space, with fully stocked kitchen that I used to make my self meals.  Karen was very kind and allowed me to use basic supplies, and made sure I had everything I needed.  She answered her texts promptly, and accommodated my very late arrival with grace.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks, Karen."
9597053,111378468,2016-10-31,2823052,John,"The historic home was cozy, warm and comfortable. Karen was a wonderful host and made our stay very enjoyable. It was situated close to downtown shopping and restaurants and The Capital."
9597053,112622380,2016-11-06,49625487,Stephanie,Nice home in local neighborhood. Very close to downtown Salem. Host was very accessible and easy to work with. Thank you Karen!
9597053,114910385,2016-11-20,4083035,Jill,"Karen's home is cozy, spic and span! We chose this location for the wonderful access to walking/running along the Willamette River. There is a beautiful pedestrian bridge near by to cross the river into a nice park and West Salem where we could grab a cup of coffee and groceries. We also enjoyed Downtown Salem's shopping. The BEST restaurant for food from scratch:  Word of Mouth  - 5 star and as good as Grandma's!
    Thank you, Karen, for your warm welcome."
9597053,117246310,2016-12-05,46886568,Joseph,"Very comfortable, pleasant accommodation! The kitchen was quite well-equipped, and Karen was a gracious host. We liked the out-of-the-way location near the river too! Will stay here again when in Salem."

9597053,121917801,2016-12-19,35572816,Beth,"Karen is a warm, responsive host and her home is cute and cozy. The kitchen is well stocked, the home contained everything you could want or need, and she even put out toys for our kids to play with! It was a great little location to stay at while visiting family for Christmas. We can't wait to come back when the weather is warm and walk to the park and breakfast place everyone talks about :)"
9597053,124387028,2017-01-01,37057819,Iisa,"The town of Salem is very fun! I will say you have to look hard for fun stuff to do but it is there! There is a very active night life and a mall just up the street from Karen's house. Karen is truly a kind woman and her house is a great place to stay. My husband and I enjoyed the fireplace in the living room and ordering food in :) I will say that the bed is very squeaky , there is a load bell every time the door is opened and closed, and trains pass by all hours of the day including the night, so if you are a light sleeper keep that in mind. "
9597053,128162409,2017-01-22,30469133,Callie,Karen's cute little home had all we needed for our short stay.

9597053,130704279,2017-02-07,52648901,Kathleen,"This charming vintage home is in an excellent location for either travel west, or downtown.  It is walking distance from Grocery Outlet and a great thrift store.  Though away traveling, Karen left a couple of delicious carrot cupcakes in the fridge for us, as well as necessities to get us started. We enjoyed a week of quiet, rainy days, many good meals prepared in this well-equipped kitchen, and hours of pleasure reading, naps, etc. while our daughter studied for her teacher certification tests.  It was an excellent choice for us - a home away from home!   Bruce and Katy Peet"
9597053,131115554,2017-02-10,7155464,Hayden,"Again, Karen's place is great!"

Great locations close to everything and the house was so cute, large rooms and a cozy feeling! Would defiantly stay again!"

9597053,150681088,2017-05-08,52595309,Daniel,"Karen provides a great retreat and value.  We loved the river-adjacent location, and we loved everything about the home.  Karen was available for any issues but did not intrude at all - a perfect combo for a host.  "
9597053,152476160,2017-05-16,7714973,Mark,"Karen's place is in a quite spot just outside the center of Salem. She is a very considerate host and her home offers good value.
"
9597053,153809953,2017-05-21,130096349,Jessica,"Note this is my very first foray into the Airbnb world. I'm so glad we chose this particular listing and host - We loved staying at Karen's! We were here for a three-night weekend and couldn't have been more pleased with this lovely gem. We can't wait to stay here again! Also note that ""We"" consisted of two brothers + two wives. The only reason I say this is that from prior experience one needs to make sure that when sharing one bathroom you all get along :) The gist of this review is that we loved the house, we loved our hostess, and we would definitely stay again. 10/10 If you would like to read on though, here are some Additional details below. Getting there/Location: Easy enough with the GPS, and made even easier with ample pre-arrival communication from Karen. Roughly 8 minutes to fairgrounds, 10minutes to city center. We loved being close to everything! Oh. And it was a short walk or quick drive to either Grocery Outlet or Fred Meyers for any kind of restocking needs. The hostess: Prior to arrival, I was a bit nervous. Karen was patient enough to answer my questions and she was always relatively quick to respond. We had the pleasure of meeting her in person when we arrived. She is a gracious hostess and had put out some fresh flowers. What a nice touch! She told us a little bit about the house and we enjoyed learning a little backstory of the house prior to her purchasing it. She takes wonderful care of the place. She is always available to assist as she lived on the premises, but always gave us our space too. The home: House was clean, well-stocked, well-appointed. Separate entry to the rented space. Accurately described, homey, and charming. Bonus points for the red accents as I do love red :) Cool/hot on thermostat, fireplace, patio - loved it all. I would stay here any time of the year. Didn't get to use the TV as we were out all day and just cooked and visited with each other at night. Wifi access was quick. Some people mentioned the train. We heard it a couple of times, but it was distant enough to where it wasn't a bother to us, or we were already up. I recommend earplugs for light sleepers. Kitchen/Dining room I loved that Karen has the kitchen stocked with some basic things to get her guests started. We got in late in the evening and we're grateful to be able to make a simple breakfast the next morning - Very important when attending an all-day convention. And Yes it has a coffee maker :) we loved being able to eat in and visit at the dinner table. We hand-washed throughout the weekend but there is also a dishwasher available. Sleeping arrangements: Accurately described. We were comfortable and had lots of room to move around or hang out. For us two couples: there is a wall..."
9597053,155711483,2017-05-28,15648082,April,Our family arrived and we're so pleasantly surprised to find the house had so many wonderful things available. Karen was such a wonderful amazing hostess! She greeted us and helped us with any questions we had had. We had two kids and she graciously shared some of her grandkids toys and they loved it. Her house made out trip feel like we were home. I wouldn't just recommend this home I'm booking this again and again. Thanks Karen for being so friendly. And I only gave it 4 stars for accuracy because the pictures don't do this diamond enough justice. 
9597053,165337647,2017-07-01,119947175,Walter,"Sehr viel Platz für mich alleine, genug Raum für 4. Ruhig und komfortabel. Toller Service der nicht angeboten war. Sehr sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was selbständiges Wohnen erfordert. Auto empfehlenswert aber zur Not auch für Fußgänger machbar. 20 Minuten Fußweg ins Zentrum oder in den großen Park am Flußufer. "
9597053,166209572,2017-07-03,102435863,Amy,"We loved our stay at Karen's!  It was quiet, clean, really comfortable - a true respite for us.  We would come back any time!  Your house is lovely Karen, and we felt so at home thanks to all of your efforts."
9597053,168883863,2017-07-10,42935107,Jon,"Karen is fantastic. She has a lovely home and has everything you'll need for your stay. I had forgotten about the train nearby and had a rude awakening at 1 am but it was my own fault for forgetting. Regardless, the home is worth the value."
9597053,171097645,2017-07-16,9449214,Natalie,"Staying at Karen's place was an absolute joy and was very comfortable. I was in town for a wedding and Karen helped me get acquainted with the area and also was flexible when I had an extra guest join at the last minute. She also provided coffee, tea, and anything I needed in her spacious and beautiful kitchen with garden views. My only regret is not being able to spend more time relaxing in her beautiful home. I would definitely recommend her place to families or couples looking for a lovely and quiet place to relax in Salem. "
9597053,174035487,2017-07-24,73786675,Ling-Yen,Karen's house could not have been more ideal for our needs. There is a nice private bedroom and room for a friend to sleep in the spacious living room. The large kitchen and dining area became our common space. It is close to downtown and the park where the Salem Art Festival is held. Karen was welcoming and a great communicator. We hope to stay with her again next year.
9597053,176786422,2017-07-31,3208932,Christy And Arnaud,Karen's place is so lovely. It was the perfect house for out-of-town guests here for our wedding and provided me a quiet place to sleep before my wedding day! I love the open kitchen and super cute art throughout the home.
9597053,179884919,2017-08-08,5913556,Matthew,"Karen's place is an older Northwest cottage in a quiet and shady little neighborhood about a mile north of downtown Salem.  The furnishings are basic but comfortable.  Nice kitchen, quiet bedroom, the bathroom is a bit cramped.  Karen is an easygoing and generous hostess.  She made us feel very comfortable, responded promptly to communications and let us keep our gear in the house all day on the day we departed.  Her consideration and flexibility enhanced the experience for us."
9597053,183235124,2017-08-16,85487169,Alida,"Karen's home is lovely.   It's clean, cozy and has many amenities.  Tucked away across from the Willamette River, we were able to enjoy quiet early morning walks.  Just minutes from downtown and Riverfront park.   Karen was warm and thoughtful.   We really felt like this was a home away from home."
9597053,185515509,2017-08-21,133604070,Caroline,"We had a lovely stay at Karens B&B during the Solar Eclips. Our children were provided with fresh tomatoes from her garden, some games and Lego to play with. For our kids and ourselves, it was a pleasure staying at a B&B in stead of all the Hotels we stayed before."
9597053,186516834,2017-08-24,130021647,Daniel,"Comfortable hotels in Salem can be quite expensive for what they offer. Karen's place is clean, roomy and is a great value for the area. She is a great host, communicates clearly and in a timely manner. We would be happy to stay here again the next time we visit Salem."
9597053,189146448,2017-08-31,14746007,Cynthia,We loved staying at Karens beautiful place.
9597053,190255288,2017-09-03,3293448,Amy,"Karen's place was a perfect home base for our weekend adventures in Salem.  It was clean, comfortable, conveniently located, and had everything we needed.  Karen was away during our stay and she let us know we could call if we needed, but the communication was so great beforehand that everything went as smoothly as could be.  Even without meeting her, we could tell that she takes pride in her home and enjoys hosting travelers.  We appreciated that she thoughtfully put out some toys, which made our 3-year-old daughter feel so special!"
9597053,192994740,2017-09-11,131286595,Trina&Gary,"We had a comfortable 4 night stay here. Communication was great and instructions provided for easy access. Karen greeted us and made us feel welcome. The space is generously sized and parking very convenient. The house is located in more of a light industrial than residential area. Downtown is walkable (although a little further than expected) and very convenient if you have access to a vehicle. Overall, a good-value stay in Salem."
9597053,194766167,2017-09-17,9643975,Eric,Karen had good communication.
9597053,197159322,2017-09-24,126511067,Deborah,"Similar feedback to other guests.  

Cons are the noisy train (didn't bother me except the last night when it went by at least 6 times and blew its horn every 2 seconds) and the neighborhood doesn't feel as walkable as I had hoped.  (Industrial without sidewalks was a little intimidating for traveling.)

BUT, it was a great stay in Karen's home.  Everything I needed (and more) for a pleasant stay.  

Her communication with me prior to the stay was good.  Not too early so the email got buried and not so late that I worried that I wouldn't know how to get in or where to go.

Karen greeted me and helped me carry my stuff in from the car.  I know she was available if I needed anything.  (I didn't because it was all there.)  There was a welcome book with intro to the house, instructions for use and how to leave things when I left, and tips on local points of interest (as well as a whole basket of brochures of same).  Decent channel selection and on-demand for when I felt like staying in.  Centrally located to everything worth seeing (IMO) in Salem."
9597053,198238166,2017-09-28,65549284,Arnaud,The house was comfy and very clean. We had the 1st floor to ourselves. We also enjoyed the terrace and garden. Karen offered us some tomatoes from her garden. We had a lovely time in Salem.
9597053,201645307,2017-10-08,130322299,Karen,"This was a charming place to stay, with great parking and a nice location close to downtown Salem. Karen was nice enough to even make up the couch bed for us. This was an old house with its quirks, but all in all a lovely place to stay for a weekend wedding. Thanks!"
9597053,204175251,2017-10-16,134121999,Sean,"Karen made everything so easy. The house was clean, comfortable and in a good location for our daily activities."

9597053,209652063,2017-11-05,79045973,Dominic,"I was in town to run a race at Silver Falls State Park and decided to say in Salem. Karen's place was perfect. It's comfortable, spacious and has everything you need and then some. It was close to everything in Salem including some great local coffee spots and places to eat. Can't say enough about Karen as a host either. The space was available early and she also gave me the flexibility to check out a little late, much appreciated as I was moving a little slowly after running a 50k. Highly recommend Karen's great apartment if you are staying in Salem!"
9597053,211674321,2017-11-13,154121450,Lzz,"Karen has created a wonderful, homey place to stay in this historic Salem house. It’s very comfortable with a well-equipped kitchen and cozy living room and bedroom. Super grateful that there was a washer and dryer, as well!! 

Karen’s house is very conveniently located. My sister and I️ had such a great time staying here and I️ hope we’ll have another chance to stay here in the future!"
9597053,213119453,2017-11-19,33330622,Rachel,"Karen was an amazing host, and she obviously puts a lot of thought into her place and guests. She was super friendly and always quick to respond to messages. She left helpful tips about the place and local attractions. She even shared a great story about the history of her house. Karen's place is to die for. It felt like home. It's within walking distance to the Gilbert children's museum and Salem indoor carousel. She had games available for us to play with our kiddos. There was breakfast, and good coffee. The place is bigger than I expected, and the neighborhood quiet and seemed secure. It's right down the street from the Oregon School of Massage, which was where my husband needed to be for the weekend. It couldn't have been more perfect. My five-year old even insisted we move in!"
9597053,216435650,2017-12-03,37136828,Carla,Karen's place is absolutely lovely. Very comfy and cozy. Close enough to walk to downtown Salem and close also to Willamette which is why we were there. Will stay there again for sure!

9597053,228449551,2018-01-19,3946440,Elizabeth,"We especially appreciated the large, well-stocked kitchen and complete laundry facilities. The house is centrally located, convenient to downtown Salem. The neighborhood is zoned commercial, and there are small businesses nearby as well as other residences along the river. It was a comfortable mix for us and a comfortable, enjoyable stay."
9597053,231150916,2018-01-30,47647666,Margaret,"Comfortable and spacious space. Quiet, warm and welcoming."
9597053,232394024,2018-02-04,75661753,Theresa,Perfect home away from home. Quiet. Exceptionally clean and user friendly. Centrally located and easy access to downtown Salem and the government offices. I highly recommend you consider this property if you are going to Salem.
9597053,235165251,2018-02-15,164596159,Bradley,"If your looking for a stylish, clean, and affordable place to call home for a little Karen’s is your place."
9597053,236223576,2018-02-18,10201840,Melody,"My husband and I spent two nights at Karen's place. The space fit our needs well and was more spacious than I expected. The location was a mix of industrial, apartments, and cute neighborhood very close to the river. This was our first visit to Salem. It would easily accommodate an additional couple with plenty of privacy for everyone. The coffee she provided was great and directions were very clear and organized. Overall we enjoyed the space."
9597053,240403071,2018-03-04,2995642,James And Seong,"I have stayed at Karen’s place many times. The apartment is very spacious, comfortable and clean. The full use of the well stocked kitchen makes it my first choice when working in Salem. Karen is super responsive and accommodating."
9597053,242711821,2018-03-12,91450340,Renee,Karen was a thoughtful host and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay! The location was very convenient for our frequent back and forth visits to Willamette University. A great place for WU parents!

9597053,252934577,2018-04-12,24386598,Anne,Lovely little cottage close to Downtown Salem. It was perfect for our short stay to visit my son. We had a medical emergency in the middle of the night and it was only 8 minutes from the most amazing hospital. Karen greeted us on our arrival and check in was super easy.

Take the time to read the few notes in the guest book and learn the history of the house and the fun quirks of the home. A great place to stay for our family of four!
9597053,261696598,2018-05-06,185225333,Addison,Karen is a very sweet host and went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and smooth as possible. Highly recommend!

Well appointed. 
Quiet neighborhood right off the main roads."
9597053,264767652,2018-05-14,7323845,Valerie,"Great location and lovely space.  Just be aware that the plugs in the bedroom don't work once you turn off the lights for the night--you have to charge your devices accordingly (or in another room).  This is a complete house for someone who wants to cook, entertain a small group, or have an extended stay, but it's also great for a short visit."
9597053,265924708,2018-05-18,136834278,Bryon,The place was wonderful. Exactly what we needed. The host was really attentive to some needs and was happy to help. Can't say enough good things.

9597053,279835715,2018-06-21,111021516,Allison,Wow. A beautiful home in a beautiful setting. I was lucky enough to be present on a day where the lawn had been freshly mowed. I say this because there is an abundance of mint in the yard and it made the outside (and inside if the window was open) smell so lovely like fresh mint. Karen was a delightful host and gave me the privacy I needed as I was on a work trip. It is a historic house that has an interesting story and a couple quirks (hence the less than 5 stars on the amenities). Other than that I highly recommend this home to anyone who stays in Salem for business or for pleasure. Thank you for hosting me and sharing the beautiful space with me!
9597053,280669272,2018-06-23,340861,Kelly,Had a great stay. Everything as described. Will definitely book again.

The minty smell to the lawn, the rogue rabbits eating clover in the yard, the guy walking his cats down Water street, the river, the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was truly magical. Thoughtful touches and helpful brochures plus extras at every turn made this a wonderful place to stay!"

Dayna"
9597053,290061370,2018-07-13,39253157,Jonathan,"Really nice space. Clean/ well maintained.  Two beautiful decks and the river is a half-block away. Salem is charming and the downtown is a really short drive/ 15 minute walk to the Broadway district/ 25 minutes to downtown. There is some warehouse district feel just a 2 block from her place, so you may not want to walk at night, but the location was great for getting around Salem. "

9597053,620236683,2020-03-21,235803897,Zoha,"I had the pleasure of staying at Karen’s home for almost a month. Her home is very spacious and has everything you can possibly need. My original stay was planned for 2 months, but my time had to be cut short due to coronavirus as my internship ended much sooner than I anticipated. Karen was very understanding of my difficult situation and communicated with me & provided me with a refund for the nights I did not stay at her place. I’m so grateful to have met Karen and I hope to reconnect with her in the future once coronavirus goes away! Thank you, Karen!"

Karen, the host, lives upstairs and is readily available if you need help.  She also gives ""space"" to her guests so it is a perfect combination.  Located a block off the river, there are plenty of birds to occupy your time when sitting on the back deck.  As with all older homes, it provides plenty of charm and character.  We will definitely come back."
9597053,637489057,2020-07-12,215080026,Brandon,Karen is a friendly and accommodating host with a comfortable and roomy place with everything needed for a short or a long stay.

9597053,656167415,2020-08-24,92634298,Katherine,"Karen’s home is a lovely home away from home. It has everything you need and it is very comfortable. It is close to the Willamette River, near a wonderful park, but having a car or plan on using Uber is to get around."
9597053,661320395,2020-09-06,22468263,Virginia,"Karen has a beautiful home that is clean and cozy! The downstairs was just for us and it was perfect. We loved being able to sit out on the back porch and the area has some nice streets for walks! Karen wasn’t home for most of our short stay, but was so kind to give us great tips about the area! When she did come home she was very friendly but also gave us our space (we had just gotten back from a long day of exploring). I would highly recommend staying here, beautiful home and kind host!"
9597053,671881177,2020-10-06,22932707,Kayla,Karen was a great host - quick to respond and very sweet. We needed a long-term place to stay for a seasonal job and this was an excellent option. Great kitchen and living space. I also loved having an outdoor patio to sip coffee in the morning. I’d recommend having a car or expecting to use public transportation in this neighborhood. Overall great spot!
9956213,59174795,2016-01-07,34958322,Thu,Ernest and Tal are great hosts. House was immaculate and had everything we needed. We really appreciate that it's a one level home that is great for family with younger children. Safe and quiet neighborhood with very easy access to restaurants.  We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Salem.
9956213,61932322,2016-02-09,55041645,Jimmy,Ernest and Tai made my family feel very welcome in their warm relaxed and beautiful home. I would 100% stay again .

The house was clean and nice, well stocked (aside from no mixing bowls or serving dishes), and in a nice neighborhood! There was a park nearby within walking distance. We enjoyed the Kuerig in the kitchen and use of the laundry area. The beds were comfortable and the linens in great condition! "
9956213,72312309,2016-05-01,58927757,Elizabeth,Neighborhood is great! Family orientated. Perfect for any family!

My business partner and I will certainly be back! Thanks, Ernest!"
9956213,79323008,2016-06-12,23394605,Jeremy,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and am really looking forward to coming back! I was pleased with the accommodations provided, as well as the amenities included. Ernest was very helpful not only in making reservations but also in ensuring we all had a comfortable stay. My family and I look forward to returning for another vacation!"
9956213,82087054,2016-06-26,10595746,Megan,"Ernest was fantastic to rent from.  He communicated everything promptly and accurately.  He even checked in with us to make sure we were able to access the house and had everything we needed.  The house is in a great location with grocery stores and restaurants very close.  It backs up to a busy road, but we had no issues with noise or traffic.  We brought our bicycles and had easy access to bike lanes on the local roads that lead out to the river and farmland area.  Absolutely beautiful area to cycle.  We were in town to attend a convention over the weekend and it was so nice to stay in a home rather than a hotel."
9956213,83930502,2016-07-04,34069207,Laura,Ernest's home was beautiful and well suited for our family!

We were able to check in at s good time and were welcomed with a nice note and basket of snacks. The house was lovely and perfectly sized for our group of 6 (2 couples and 2 single women). The kitchen was stocked well and we enjoyed a nice dinner from the grill on one night. There was ample parking and folks should know that Salem does not yet have über/lyft so a car is probably necessary to get around. Thanks for a wonderful stay!
9956213,94888101,2016-08-17,88828234,Subbu,"It was refreshing to go inside this beautiful home after a long drive. Everything was perfect and when I had a question, Ernest replied back immediately and even called me to confirm. Glad that I choose this house instead of staying in a hotel."

9956213,103260197,2016-09-21,92879243,Jenessa,"Ernest was quick to respond to my questions and made our stay incredibly easy. He had all of the amenities listed on his site, and even provided some snacks and coffee/tea. I would 100% recommend staying at Ernest's ""Immaculate AC"" if you find yourself needing a home to stay at in Salem."
9956213,120094462,2016-12-07,52212,Julia,House was exactly as described and we had a wonderful stay.  The house was clean and comfortable.

9956213,122314607,2016-12-22,27861380,Robert,"Book here!

I planned a trip for my wife for her 30th Birthday and stayed at Ernest's for 4 days. Leading up to the trip, Ernest did an amazing job making sure we had all the information we needed to ensure a comfortable stay. While we were there, he texted me one time just to see how we were doing and if we had any questions. (Up to this point, I never had a host do that for me) NOT to mention he left a bottle of Sparkling Cider for the birthday girl.

The house was extremely clean and was way more suited for my wife and I while we were visiting Salem. The icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that it had snowed the week before and just added to the perfect ambiance. I can't stress how amazing our trip was and highly consider you choose this for your next trip to Salem. I can't thank Ernest enough for being such a great host and for always being in a perfect balance of communication.

We both highly recommend this place. Thanks Ernest!!"

9956213,131123382,2017-02-10,113138366,June,"This home truly is immaculate! The homewide wood floors were shiny clean!  So much cleaner than a hotel.  It offers multiple vehicle  offstreet parking; a well appointed modern kitchen including spices teas coffee ...all kinds of stuff to fell comfortable;  always fresh ventilation. Decor is ""modern comfortable""! Lots of natural light and high ceilings so it feels real open.  The furnace kept us comfy while the gas fireplace added the cozy factor!  It's in a residential neighborhood so we felt safe and secure. There is a little traffic noise heard in the bedrooms but it is a suburban area so it's to be expected.  Lovely bed and bath linens and plentiful.  Being a one level home it's so easy to move around in. This is an overall superior place to stay! We were so pleased to stay here!"
9956213,131551015,2017-02-12,100151958,Christian,"Ernest was helpful and accomodating for the entire experience.

9956213,147775318,2017-04-28,9216481,Kevin,Well equipped house in the south side of Salem. Every toiletry needed is supplied and the whole place is very clean. We have stayed in many rentals over the years and this might be the best from that viewpoint. It is somewhat distant from the center but there are places to eat and shop within a 5 minute drive. We would certainly recommend it to those who need to visit Salem.

It was extremely clean and had every comfort, convenience, and amenity we could desire! It was very reasonably priced when compared to hotel costs for a group of our size (we had 4 adults and a kid). We hope we can stay here when we're in the area again.  Ernest (the owner) was an excellent host. Though we never met him, he communicated with us a lot via phone and text, making sure we had all we needed. Check in/check out process was a breeze as well! This place was awesome :)"

We had some difficulties turning the fire place on and Ernest texted back with more information and was even willing to come by and take a look at it for us.  We did get the fireplace to work. The location was great for us.  It was in a nice neighborhood.  Did not anticipate a busy road on the back side of the house.  Woke up on the first morning to the sound of cars and trucks, but was not a deal breaker for us.  Would stay here again.  Thank you!"

9956213,340390615,2018-10-23,196451493,Michelle,Ernest & Tal's place was a perfect home away from home for my family. They were quick to respond to my many questions prior to our trip. There was plenty of room for our party. The home was clean and the beds were comfortable. I appreciated the nightlights that were strategically placed to help us navigate throughout the home. I would highly recommend this place and look forward to staying there again.

9956213,355796805,2018-12-05,82425852,Tom,"Awesome, clean place. We ended up only staying there for two nights but were contemplating staying for three. Ernest checked in with us and let us know that we were more than welcome to stay longer, even though we hadn't booked it yet. Great, personalized service! Thank you!"
9956213,362589466,2018-12-26,18475918,Shauna,Ernest & Tal's place is a nice clean place to stay with easy access from I-5.  All the necessary amenities were provided.  Check-in and out was super easy.  Thanks again!

9956213,414168782,2019-02-18,92977810,Matt,The house is in very good shape -- clean and easy to occupy.  The location is pretty convenient to shops and eats in south Salem.
9956213,425723968,2019-03-18,240289566,Don,"This was my first experience with AirBnB and it was great!  Everything was as advertised, the house was sparkling clean,  and ready for our visit.  The hosts were responsive and checked up on us via text to make sure everything was good.  The location worked very well for us and in general is in a great location to get around Salem.  I am now an AirBnB fan and I hope all our experiences are as good as this one."
9956213,428750986,2019-03-25,196226762,Noemi,Very clean and comfortable home. Hosts are quick to respond and gracious.

9956213,443794825,2019-04-26,256546964,Jill,"Our first airbnb and I can't imagine others even coming close to comparing. A quick check in note from the host, letting us know they were available should we need anything.  The house offered a warm welcome, we couldn't have been more pleased."
9956213,452725826,2019-05-13,246499452,Jim,"Ernest & Tal's place is very clean and all our basic needs were meet, than some.  Their 3 bedroom home was very comfortable for all our family members.  We really appreciated their home and will stay again, if the need arises."
9956213,455443594,2019-05-19,120114172,Heidi,Perfect place to relax. Ernest and Tal's place was comfortable and had everything we needed.
9956213,464493042,2019-06-05,98658247,Sharon,"Very clean and very comfortable in an established neighborhood. I didn't like the hotels in the area so I went this route. Paid the same as a hotel room but got an entire house instead! Because it is centrally located, be prepared for traffic noise. I have trouble sleeping anyway so I used a sleep machine app on my phone. The deck provides a nice place to have coffee, but you will have that same traffic noise. For me, it was a great trade-off for having stores close-by like Dollar Tree, WalMart, WinCo, Roth's Grocery, Walgreens, fast food, restaurants, gas stations and the fabulous Dutch Bros. Coffee drive-thru. Check out the menu for the place, it is incredible. Truly a Super Host experience with Ernest & Tal!"
9956213,471050769,2019-06-16,233076117,Toni,"Very clean, nice neighborhood & hosts are very accomodating. Highly recommended for all!"
9956213,479296262,2019-06-30,268620439,Jennifer,Exactly as advertised.  Very clean and prompt responses from hosts. Safe neighborhood.

9956213,620317640,2020-03-21,152268603,Susan,"Ernest and Tal were great hosts, with fast responses, flexibility when ur plans changed and just in general good people.  Their home was just what we needed for a family gathering when my mom was ill.  We could cook and gather together in a great space as well as have our own private spaces (3 brothers with their sister).  And it was a perfect location for us, close to everything we needed."
9956213,622314821,2020-04-12,261624733,Alisha,What a great place to stay and the neighborhood is super nice too. House has tons of space and love all the homey touches!

9956213,635774068,2020-07-07,98252377,Remy,Perfect house for longer stays. Earnest & Tal are some of the better hosts you will find on AirBnb; they checked in on us and helped with anything we needed right away. The space was perfect for the 3 of us to live in for the month we stayed. Location wise the house is very close to oregon wine country to the east  of salem in a very quiet part of town where you have little chance to be bothered.
9956213,641490312,2020-07-23,2807902,Jerrad,Really nice and clean. The bed in the master is super comfortable! Ernest is great to deal with
9956213,644365120,2020-07-30,78953529,Veronica,"Ernest and Tal’s place is very clean and cozy. Their home offers many of the essentials you look for and more. It’s located in a quiet and nice neighborhood, only a short drive to shops and restaurants. They are very responsive and great hosts!  We will recommend their place to our friends!"
9956213,673644254,2020-10-11,260061120,Priscila,"Everything was as described, incredibly clean and cozy. You’ll have everything to feel at home. Highly recommended!"
10074172,60443308,2016-01-23,40198114,Brent,"Nick was responsive, inviting and professional. The pictures don't do the place justice. It's actually nicer in real life. How many times does that happen!? The bedroom, as well as the entire house, is extremely clean and quiet. The neighborhood is charming and a nice walk to the heart of Salem. I would stay here again anytime. In fact, I have decided to stay an extra night. 

-Brent Wallis"
10074172,61099053,2016-01-31,50763756,Caitlin,Nick was great to communicate with. He lives out of town so I didn't get to meet him but he walked me through everything I needed to know. The security lighting outside is very comforting.
10074172,71115664,2016-04-23,7648352,Rebecca,The room was very pleasant to stay in along with the house. Nick was easy to communicate with. Great stay. 
10074172,71887366,2016-04-29,28354184,Laurence,"Not sure how you could do better for the money. Quick communication, simple instructions and a quiet night's sleep. Excellent AirB&B experience. Thanks!"
10074172,78221608,2016-06-05,6617439,Scott,"Nick was a great host and was awesome at communicating!  Every time I had a question he was very responsive.  Neighborhood was quiet and quaint and the house matched that well.  We did not spend much time there, but it was all convenient and worked very well for us."
10074172,79133748,2016-06-11,388827,Annette,"Nick was pleasant and welcoming in his communications, the house is lovely, and the neighborhood seems quiet, pleasant and safe. We had some challenges with the scented products used in the room (finally discovered the nightlight was a diffuser and un-plugged it) and the fact that there were multiple guests there, more like a boarding house, not someone's personal home. The bed was too soft for our taste as well. I'm sure it would be fine for some, but not for us."
10074172,79594876,2016-06-13,61816900,Ethan,The house was in a great location away from the hustle of busy streets. The pictures don't do the house or room justice. Clean and very inviting. I would most definitely plan to stay here again.
10074172,80537993,2016-06-18,72574726,Eric,"Everything was clean, the house was beautiful, and the neighborhood was quiet. It was great to be within easy biking distance from downtown Salem without having to stay there!"
10074172,81460195,2016-06-23,72024403,Faith,Ended up extending my stay a second night and Nick was super accommodating with an early check-in
10074172,81593092,2016-06-24,72024403,Faith,"This place was great for a brief stay - big rooms, clean, super comfy bed, and the price was perfect. "
10074172,82039250,2016-06-26,79136069,Danette,Accurate 
10074172,83055448,2016-07-01,970845,John,"Nick was a great host.  He was super responsive and made me feel welcome at every  turn.  The property was just as advertised and perfectly suited my needs and expectations.  I won't hesitate to return the next time my travels bring me to Salem, OR.    "
10074172,83446929,2016-07-03,75995680,Asha,Everything was as mentioned in the description. Nick was very responsive to my questions and accommodating for my late arrival. I would  recommend the place to anyone! :)
10074172,83703794,2016-07-04,18198514,Kishan,Nick was a fantastic host. Whole set up is easy and the house is beautiful as mentioned. Quiet roommates and everything you would need for a peaceful night. The museum of mental health nearby is fun if you have time. The word of mouth bistro recommended is one of the best breakfasts I've had. Go super early as it crowds up or if you're alone it should be fine. Such a comfy bed along with easy in and out makes this a great trip.
10074172,85060582,2016-07-10,59673629,Patrick,"As with all of the reviews that I saw, Nick and the place are great. Great old-charm house with beautiful wood accents throughout. Quiet, clean, and just as he described it. Two thumbs up!"
10074172,85113334,2016-07-10,7251620,Winifred,The room was clean and spacious. Nick was a very responsive and easy to reach. The only downfall was that the doorknob was broken and we couldnt/ didn't feel safe leaving our things in the room unmonitored with other guests and we almost got locked in our room and couldn't get out from the broken doorknob. 
10074172,85445424,2016-07-11,39088797,Sarah,"This space is charming and a great space for a quick trip or maybe a week.  I plan to stay here again.  It was quiet and very clean.  Nick was very helpful at making me feel like I had everything for my stay.  
Mahalo for the hospitality.  "
10074172,87220499,2016-07-19,73786675,Ling-Yen,"Nick's house in Salem is spacious and clean and in a quiet, nice neighborhood. It has a great shared kitchen and dining area, and our room (#1) was roomy and we could not hear the other residents at all. We had a great stay."
10074172,88270520,2016-07-23,25871779,Simone Skovgaard,"Booked this place for my parents. They had some issues with the cleaning, so I immediately texted Nick, who took care of if it right away. Other than that the house had a perfect location and brand new appliances!  "
10074172,88705008,2016-07-25,14983196,Dora,"The host was very responsive and very prompt with messages. He messaged me with all the details needed to access the home. He also checked in with me frequently to make sure that all the needs of my party was met. 
The room and bathroom was beautiful! The rooms were clean and the decor was very nice. Both my mom and brother said it was their favorite place to stay out of all the places that we stayed during our Washington and Seattle trip. The house was also in a nice and safe neighborhood. 
I would definitely recommend this place to others and intend on coming back when I visit Oregon again. "
10074172,90216251,2016-07-31,81919275,Alex,Nick was great! Everything in the house was accurate from the listing description. House is very lovey in a pleasant neighborhood. Beautiful home.
10074172,91053933,2016-08-03,58033312,Tiffany,"Nick is great about getting back to potential guests, he was easy to communicate with and answered my emails within hours. I went for a nice run, the neighborhood has a few parks and wide streets that are perfect for running.  

This was the first time I've used Airbnb myself but a friend works for corporate Airbnb and I've booked them for my mother so I'm familiar with the idea. It doesn't appear that Nick lives here, which he says in the listing; there are multiple Airbnb guests staying in all the rooms. I was alone with two other men and as a single female, I didn't feel very comfortable, especially when one came home at 2:30am. I think I would have felt better if Nick had been there just in case there was a problem. I reread the reviews and noticed that a lot of the women who stayed here were with a significant other, which would have made me feel safer. So this doesn't really reflect on the place, which I would say is as described, but is good to take into consideration in case it might be an issue for you."
10074172,91481931,2016-08-05,1015064,Jackson,Great value for late reservations
10074172,92356338,2016-08-08,74185509,Derek,Nick is kind man and father.  He  will take care of any problems right away!   
10074172,93638288,2016-08-13,87996189,Laura,"I did not want to leave when my reservation was over! Nick's older home has been beautifully remodeled, but without losing the feeling of going back in time. It was nice and quiet and the gourmet kitchen was a huge plus along with the enormous outdoor space and porch swing! The room was bright and full of windows and with a great view of the trees. There were plenty of extra linens and blankets and lots of small touches.  I hope that I will have the opportunity to return or for family members to be able to stay ! "
10074172,95589225,2016-08-20,86851442,Kristian,"Nick was a great host and answered any question I had during my stay right away. 

The room was exactly as described and shown on the pictures: Large and with easy access to a nice bathroom. The shared kitchen facilities worked out great as well. 

The room will be perfect if you have business to do in Salem and need a place to stay. "
10074172,95923188,2016-08-21,46577148,Lizzie,The listing was very accurate and the house is just beautiful! So much space and has everything you would need. 
10074172,96576321,2016-08-23,59108866,Nichole,The room was exactly as described. Safe neighborhood.  Charming front porch swing. We only spent one night. And was just me and teen daughter. We felt comfortable even with other roommates in house.  Very clean spacious home with nice furnishings. Nick even offered that we could use laundry room which was great since we had been on the road for 4 days. Nick is very organized and accommodating as a host. Very appreciative for his flexibility and great communication. Would stay again and recommend. 
10074172,97790069,2016-08-28,86396217,Chelsea,The room was big.  The bed is super comfy.  The tentants were very nice.  The living room was quiet and comfy.  The neighborhood is quiet and very little traffic.  I was able to walk to Johnny's to get dinner.  The porch swing is a great touch.
10074172,99045875,2016-09-03,36164027,Jacky,The room was great - love the older house feel and all amenities mentioned in the listing were provided. Would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Salem!
10074172,99417272,2016-09-04,2495610,Aaron,My experience at Nick place was great. As a seasoned airbnb user with over 20 stays I think Nick is a great host that delivers all the right amenities for a smooth and comfortable stay. Thanks for making it easy. 
10074172,100146097,2016-09-07,66634450,Wendi,"Great location, beautiful home, COMFY bed! Nick was very accommodating of my 9PM reservation, arrival by 10PM. The home was clean, and exactly as it looks in the photo. I had a hard time not staring out the window at the beautiful trees as I tried to work on my computer. I will return if I am in the area."
10074172,100697450,2016-09-10,20100961,Alex,"The room was exactly as described in a very quiet neighborhood. Nice place, I would stay here again. "
10074172,100995486,2016-09-11,56595,Aristide,"Nick was very communicative, professional and friendly. He provided all the information needed and was quick to answer my emails.

The place is about one mile from the fairgrounds and about one mile to downtown. It's two blocks from the #10 bus. "
10074172,102126227,2016-09-16,12694929,Judith,"Lovely house in good,  convenient neighborhood. Although Nick was not at the house, he replied quickly to questions by text.  Really nice to be able to do a load of laundry there - thanks, Nick!  Great location for easy bike access to downtown Salem. There is a train that goes through multiple times a night nearby, though, so bring good earplugs."
10074172,108127365,2016-10-14,50545489,Landon,Great location and nice place to stay.
10074172,109288402,2016-10-20,7468975,Karsten,Nice Room in quite neighborhood. There where other guests lodging there but I did not even see them during my stay. Will come back if traveling to Salem again .
10074172,112916398,2016-11-08,69091237,David,"The home is clean, comfortable and easy to use.  The shared kitchen and sitting room are very nice.  I arrived after 11 PM, stayed for 5 nights.  However everyday I left by 7 AM and returned about midnight so I did not meet my host.  However I texted and e-mailed and they were a responsive host."
10074172,115430773,2016-11-24,102013679,Terry,Great place for a great value. Close to downtown and east side with shopping mall and restaurants.

10074172,120329017,2016-12-09,105876276,Rose,This place is super conveniently located to the downtown. I was able to walk and bus everywhere I needed. There is food and other resources nearby. The bed was fabulously comfortable and I slept well each night.

10074172,142908389,2017-04-09,34676098,Laura,"Nick and Julie made my stay as easy as possible. While I did not see them, they were very prompt in responding to my questions that came up the first night I was there. The description of the room was very accurate with great instructions on how to access Keys. Having the kitchen space was very nice. There were plenty of pots and pans with clear notes on what was in each cabinet and drawer. Very close drive to downtown Salem. If I had wanted to I would have been able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Other guests were personable, but they kept mostly to themselves."
10074172,143643391,2017-04-12,12499722,Kevin,"Nick's place was exactly as described, clean, comfortable and a great place to stay if you are in Salem, Or."

Check in was easy, and we saw so little of the permanent residents we felt we were by ourselves. We were quite jet lagged and they were very tolerant of our dozing on the couches in the living room. "

Nested in a canopy of older mature valley trees, Nick's house provides the calm, quiet and sense of nature on this street of trees. Nick's house has plenty of natural wood and modern historical charm and creates a further sense of rest. A great place to naturally unwind after a day of go, go ,go. Great Kitchen and rooms with a view of trees. Clean and well stocked with the basics so it feels like home. Thank You Nick."
10074172,161357504,2017-06-17,132154385,Kim,"Nicks home is gorgeous! It's clean, tidy and cozy! We would stay again! Thank you Nick :)"
10074172,165702841,2017-07-01,130768948,Bob,"Nick's place is exactly as represented.  Quiet & clean.  Every night is a good night's sleep. Would happily stay there again. 
"
10074172,166886882,2017-07-04,68574395,Kristen,Nick was a really great host and resolved any issues we had promptly. The house was clean the bathrooms are nice. 
10074172,167759887,2017-07-07,60964197,Mayuri,"Wonderful house, the host was communicative and helpful at all times. The bathroom although shared is not an issue at all, the housemates were friendly and quiet. "
10074172,168606281,2017-07-09,19046260,Mary,"I travel to Salem often for work. This was my third stay at this location and I was very happy. My room was clean, quiet and comfortable as always. "
10074172,169805763,2017-07-13,8753649,Cheryl,"Nick's place was great.  The house is really beautiful. The room was well situated with a  very comfortable bed, and a desk. The shared bathroom was available whenever we needed it.  Coffee on the porch  swing was a real treat."
10074172,171104462,2017-07-16,21060964,Carrie,Great place if you're looking for privacy but don't want to pay for an entire home. Clean and comfy.
10074172,172077982,2017-07-19,140833978,Jenny,"Beautiful home, older quiet neighborhood, walking distance to great food and family friendly parks. Patty's off center Cafe has amazing food and service. I would stay again with my baby. "
10074172,174006675,2017-07-24,16480582,Gene,"They don’t live there. The house is furnished, but I’ve felt more warmth in houses “staged” by realtors. Four guest rooms, one bathroom. Because the hosts don’t live in the house, there is no-one to tell the bathroom sinks are draining slowly, or to ask for a second towel (we paid for 2 people). The whole experience was very impersonal. There’s wifi, but no TV. Due to the weather, the room was very warm. Again, no-one to ask about a fan. We sighted some other guests, but they passed like ships in the night.

Near as we can figure, the location is not walking distance of anything useful, like restaurants, or stores, so you need a car.

We have enjoyed the company of several hosts, but for the most part our Airbnb experience is like this: someone turning an unsuitable home into a commercial rooming house. And the “breakfast” of the Airbnb name? Forget it, please refer to the “they don’t live here” comment above."
10074172,180226056,2017-08-09,33453768,Nancy,The home is comfortable enough for a night's stay.  Be sure to have a flashlight if you arrive after dark so that you will be able to see to pen the lock box and to see key holes on door and to see and verify the house number.  There were no exterior lights on when we arrived.
10074172,180951524,2017-08-11,64970000,Brandy,"A nice, quiet place close to popular activities."
10074172,182077191,2017-08-13,44885746,Chihiro,"Due to an emergency situation, I had to drive over night and needed a clean,  safe, and convenient place to sleep one night to rest for another long drive.  

I found Nick's place and I booked less than 24 hours to check in time.  Nick responded and confirmed right away.  Location was convenient, room was clean, check-in was easy.    

Nick, Thank you for being a great host!"
10074172,185108454,2017-08-20,32019469,Susan,"This Airbnb was a perfect fit for our needs. The location was close to downtown Salem, yet situated in a quiet neighborhood. Hosts answered all of our needs promptly. We really enjoyed their awesome home."
10074172,196591259,2017-09-23,122249034,Shantel,A magical view and restful stay! Thank you!
10074172,201663907,2017-10-08,14736862,Todd,"Although Nick is not on site, he is very responsive to any inquiries you might have.  It is very quiet, clean, and the bed was very comfortable.  As others have noted, the interior is a bit stark - not very cozy in regard to home furnishings.  Has great potential though.  Great if you are there primarily for a place to sleep.  Nice kitchen."
10074172,203861100,2017-10-15,75746932,Bailey,Nick’s place was a fair value. This room is private with a lock. Comfy bed. It is very close to the road thus this is not a good choice if looking for a quiet place to stay. Host was not on site and I had mild issues with cleanliness of the shared bathroom. Friendly guests in other rooms. It was good for a quick stop along a road trip. If I go back to Salem to stay for longer I will choose another location.
10074172,238965727,2018-02-27,174505717,Subhakar,Great place for new people. Close to everything.
10074172,247215668,2018-03-27,179601645,Tyler,Nick had very good communication and responded to any questions we had and was even 0kay with us checking in late. The long term residents are also very nice
10074172,250945845,2018-04-06,181080761,Paul,"Nick's place was amazing! It was in a great location outside of downtown Salem. Communication was awesome throughout the experience, and good advice for food was also given. Definitely recommend!"
10074172,251334407,2018-04-07,6006802,Jennifer,"Nick really helped me out with my super late inquiry after my original host had administrative issues precluding my stay.  Nick had the room prepped and ready in short order.  The historical house is interesting.  Upstairs two other long term tenants share the one bath with airbnb guests.  It works and the bathroom is good sized. The room is very useable with a desk.  There are several pillows to use. The sheets seem new.  I like the no shoes in house policy, it keeps the floors clean.  The kitchen is available for the guests. 
The street is mostly quiet at night.
I was well rested for the next day's events."
10074172,257079994,2018-04-24,94880927,Daylena,"Very quiet residential area, near parks, hospital, numerous & diverse eating establisments and shopping. There are a couple longer term type residents, but I rarely saw them and when I did, they were friendly & polite. The room was nicely sized and the bed was COMFORTABLE! Good communication / information from the hosts. Overall this was a very good value and I  would stay again."
10074172,257335080,2018-04-25,67681672,Todd,Good location and nice host.
10074172,264805395,2018-05-14,17692480,Matsu,"Nick's location was convenient for our plans. There are 4 bedrooms upstairs in an old craftsman home with one bathroom we all shared. We were very lucky as everyone was very considerate. There was no problem sharing the bathrm. Everyone kept it clean for the next person. There is a beautiful kitchen that seemed stocked with pots and pans and dishes although we did not use it. There is also laundry facilities.  Wifi was difficult to sign into and no one to ask. It wasn't a big deal for us though, so much so we didn't even try to get in touch with Nick to see if he could help.  If you decide to stay here think big beautiful craftsman home with a  group house living feel. Things were organized and there were extra blankets.  Very comfortable but a bit sterile. We liked it because we had specific plans and knew what we were dong in Salem. We could come and go freely without interacting with anyone. That might sound a bit rough but we were scheduled out and on overload for the weekend. It worked perfect for us. Also the late check out time was helpful. Thanks Nick for letting us check in early."
10074172,267476780,2018-05-21,188172853,Shilpa,Nice place to stay.
10074172,273629460,2018-06-06,31799660,Krystal,"If you're staying in Salem, this house has all the amenities you might need located in a nice neighborhood. Easy check-in and check-out, and It seemed like 4/4 rooms of the home were Airbnbs."
10074172,274272530,2018-06-08,127545790,Tyson,The house was amazingly beautiful. Definitely a piece of architectural beauty. It was an easy check-in and I was able to arrive and quickly get to my room to get settled. It was very close to where I needed to be and to downtown Salem. I would definitely stay again.
10074172,275805692,2018-06-11,193952274,Ryan,"The house is a bit creaky, but that's just part of the appeal of an older place. The neighbor's dog might be annoying at night sometimes, but otherwise this was a great place to stay! One thing for the taller guests. I'm about 5'8 and walking down the stairs from my room I could bang my head on the weirdly low part of the ceiling if I didn't turn my head to the side. If you are any taller than me, you will have to duck every time you walk down the stairs so be careful! You won't have any other problems staying here."
10074172,277684282,2018-06-17,190219821,Brittany,Only reserved for a hot tub which was on the list of amenities but the hot tub was a bathtub with jets that wasn’t clean and was shared with a shower the roommates were using right before me. Just not as expected. 
10074172,278349760,2018-06-17,140624235,Haley,"Very quite home, a person lives their full time, said hi a few times but wasn't a social or homely place. "
10074172,285088320,2018-07-02,197172717,Yashwanth,Very nice and calm place to stay

10074172,291345293,2018-07-15,173244760,Enrique,"Nice place to stay, bed is comfortable  and in a nice neighborhood"
10074172,292757721,2018-07-18,157058372,Michelle,Highly recommended! You won’t be disappointed. 
10074172,297961456,2018-07-28,196672702,Brett,Thank you!

10074172,306536367,2018-08-12,206925368,Lisa,this is a great place
10074172,307136529,2018-08-13,183242127,Rena,The house is very nice. The furnishings are a little threadbare. The shared bathroom can sometimes be a problem. Good location to downtown. 
10074172,308568457,2018-08-16,16586216,John,Very straightforward experience which is what I’m after with Airbnb. All was as Nick said in the advertisement. 
10074172,309801277,2018-08-18,183242127,Rena,"This is a nice old house, with a good location to the downtown area.  The bathroom is shared among 3 rooms, which can sometimes be a problem. The furnishings in the rooms could be a bit more comfy and inviting."
10074172,310692243,2018-08-19,83584079,Jim,Nice house in a quiet neighborhood. Pretty close to the downtown area and the Willamette River trail. 
10074172,312554682,2018-08-23,5165657,Nicole,This room was exactly as described. The space was clean and the sheets and bed were amazing! I was super grateful for the air conditioner because Salem was so hot while I was there. I didn’t get to enjoy the space as much as I could have. The hosts were quick to respond and I was able to stay there when another situation fell through unexpectedly. Very Thankful For the quiet peaceful space. 
10074172,314500985,2018-08-26,23350045,Ann,Convenient and clean.  Shared bathroom with seems up to 3 other rooms so timing can be tricky but also half bath downstairs.  Easy to get in and house is very nice.  Bed was comfy and set up in Room #1 to have a child or 3rd person with futon on floor which worked well for us.
10074172,315391428,2018-08-28,25620333,Phil,Another great stay at Julia and Nick’s place. They’ve re-decorated the bedroom and made it even nicer. Julia was very helpful with modifying my reservation when I needed to change it.  
10074172,317889155,2018-09-02,198246248,Ben,"Very nice kitchen to cook in. It was fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils and spices."
10074172,323494806,2018-09-15,196500858,Theresa,"The house is close to downtown in an older neighborhood with lots of charm.
The inside has been updated nicely.  

Just know there is no host at the house and you will be sharing a bathroom with tenants plus other guests. 

It worked for me as I was traveling on business."
10074172,333041017,2018-10-06,145159413,Vamshi,You can prefer it without any hesitation

I recommend."

10074172,362627624,2018-12-26,39820773,David,Quiet house in a quiet and safe neighborhood. The room was clean with a very comfortable bed.  Nice (shared) bathroom and very nice kitchen stocked with good coffee.  I'll be back!
10074172,363456517,2018-12-28,7001921,Brock,A classic home with comfortable amenities and a simple check in process.

10074172,430464120,2019-03-30,247201952,Patrick,"This was my first Airbnb stay ever, and the experience was awesome! Nick provides a top notch place to stay that's clean, friendly, great location, and all the necessary amenities. It's an excellent place overall and a great value with everything you get. I will be happy to stay there again if the opportunity arises."
10074172,439809874,2019-04-19,1291185,Stephen,"Nick’s place was prefect! Great location, clean and quiet, and quick response times from the host. I would definitely recommend staying."

10074172,454647662,2019-05-18,262314029,Polly,"Nice people, clean room. Is a shared space with potentially many other Airbnb guests"
10074172,459037897,2019-05-26,102633716,Debbie,Great location for going to concerts at LB Day Amphitheatre or the Oregon State Fair. Bedroom was clean and had a comfortable bed. Quiet neighborhood with parking on the street. Be sure to get instructions on how to get your keys for self check-in in advance.
10074172,462096112,2019-06-01,133780925,Laura,"I was disappointed with this property. The reviews portrayed a clean and comfortable location, but the bathroom cleanliness did not meet my expectations. The home is a bunkhouse, and being it is historic, it is also very noisy and sound travels throughout. I was awakened by other occupants returning at 2am even though they were respectful in their noise levels... The noise just carries. With the Owners not being onsite and it being late when we arrived, I chose not to ask for resolution of these issues during my stay. 
The room was stuffy yet I was unable to keep a window open due to noisy street neighbors. 
This property was not a good fit for me and I would not recommend."
10074172,470050863,2019-06-15,24024974,Tamara,Nice location.
10074172,472938432,2019-06-20,121877957,Jacob,Beautiful house in a great neighborhood. Everything at the house was as expected and I would stay there again.
10074172,474091542,2019-06-22,3009569,Bonnie,Quiet. Wifi good. 4 bedrooms sharing one bathroom. Lock on bedroom door very difficult to work. Only a small sliding latch for locking door from inside.
10074172,478306830,2019-06-29,64069506,Casey,"Easy check-in, spacious kitchen, mutliple bathrooms. My only quibble is that the walls/floors do not insulate noise very well."

10074172,631556278,2020-06-22,347935785,Dhawani,Beautiful place with all amenities. The hosts are very helpful and respond immediately. Worth staying!

10074172,639565569,2020-07-18,304122636,Susan,Good location to access downtown Salem.  Not as clean and fresh as it could have been.  Each bedroom upstairs locks with a skeleton key.  I'm not sure how safe and secure that is.
10074172,657972024,2020-08-29,138554451,Cody,Nice location in a beautiful historic home
12232289,150408686,2017-05-07,27716949,Barry,"Nice home and young professionals...new to hosting and seeking to meet guest needs.  

Kitchen is great for those cooking but only Keurig coffee maker.  They offer use of spices and condiments so you are not limited to microwave and fast food.

Location is convenient if you have a car.  Quiet higher end sun-dried.  

   Note three curious cats and a sometimes noisy Parrot live here too.

   Presently you will be the sole occupants, save visiting felines, upstairs so detached hall bath is effectively private.

Pillow-top bed is quite comfortable; check to see if nightstands and reading lights have been added."
12232289,154685586,2017-05-25,69082718,Jia Yan,"Angela and her husband were so great. Angela messaged me prior to my arrival on an estimated arrival time so she could make sure everything was in place before I got there. Upon arrival, my friends and I were greeted by both Angela and her husband John, "

We did two college visits that day and were wiped out, so a nice, quiet, clean room with comfortable beds is exactly what we needed. Great night sleep helped get us ready for more college visits the next day. Thank you, Angela!"
12232289,172733963,2017-07-21,36464957,Susan,"Angela greeted us on our arrival and gave us a tour. She is a great communicator.  The room was exactly as described, very clean, comfortable and quiet.  The entire experience was perfect for our needs after our long drive.  Salem is a great place to walk around downtown with so very many restaurants and sights. They  even have a Carousel at the park.  It's a fantastic location and the state capitol."
12232289,185516549,2017-08-21,125388865,Daniel,Very clean and modern in a relatively new neighborhood. Short drive to downtown Salem. Loved playing with the cats too! :-)
12232289,186484854,2017-08-24,678491,Lisa,Angela's house was perfect for our Willamette freshman drop-off.  It was about 10-15 minutes from the college and downtown and the room had a comfortable double bed and a single so perfect for us.  Angela and her husband Alex were both very nice and accommodating.
12232289,251322858,2018-04-07,65171820,Kelly,"Angela and her hubby were very accommodating! We had a late arrival and were able to still quietly use kitchen for a snack. Thank you, The House is a beautiful home in a safe area. 
The beds were comfy!  Nice privacy.  They even made us breakfast !  Thank you helping with my special requests. Would stay again! "
12232289,258803875,2018-04-29,67515493,Jojo,Angela and Alex made this a 5 star stay all around for my 2 boys and I. Great communication and timely responses.

12232289,278738081,2018-06-18,20328905,Eddie,"Clean. Upstairs allows for privacy. In-room TV not available at time that we stayed, ask about this amenity if it is important to you. Shared downstairs kitchen. Located in quiet residential neighborhood. Easy street parking."

The house is gorgeous, the room and the bathroom were clean and the bed were very comfortable. 
Also, they have two adorable cats!"
12588161,72243437,2016-05-01,9975091,Michael,"Sharon is a gracious host with an impeccable home.  The room was comfortable, clean, and nicely appointed.  I can't forget to mention that the coffee in the morning was delicious!  I hope to be back soon."
12588161,76345751,2016-05-26,68677085,Jennie,Sharon was the perfect host. She made me feel welcome at all times and had thought of even the little things you often need when staying away from home. The room was lovely and furnished well. I couldn't have asked for somewhere better to stay. Otis the dog was so friendly too! 
12588161,78639949,2016-06-08,27720979,Grant,Sharon was lovely! Very friendly and was able to accommodate me on my later than planned arrival. I really liked her home and slept like a rock. Thanks Sharon!
12588161,81946201,2016-06-25,65903309,Michael,"I was there for 2 weeks of business.  Everything was exactly like the picture. Nice room quiet, and comfortable bed and rocker.  Sharon was a very good host.  Everything you needed was there and any questions asked were quickly answered.  She had told me her nephew was having a birthday there with family.  Asked if I wanted to join.  I did for a while, met and meet everyone.  Very nice family.  I excused myself as I was tired and need to get some rest for the next day's work.  Very quiet even during the birthday.  Impressed!  Thanks for a great stay."
12588161,83010567,2016-06-30,80109376,Tom,"Very pleasant stay in a lovely room. Sharon was welcoming but gave me space, and I would happily stay here again."
12588161,94182783,2016-08-15,76861620,Melissa,"Sharon's home was comfortable, clean, and was a wonderful place to stay. Sharon is a great host--available for guests when you need her, but also gives you your own space. I would recommend staying here!"

12588161,97493324,2016-08-27,29890998,Joan,"Sharon's place is actually better than I could have imagined....very clean and welcoming, just what I needed as I ushered my child off to college in Salem. "
12588161,98917580,2016-09-02,85324132,Kelsey,"Sharon was a wonderful host. We didn't see each other much, but she was always friendly and made sure I was comfortable. It was very convenient to have a microwave and coffee maker in my room. Her dog Otis is so sweet. I would recommend Sharon to anyone spending time in Salem. "
12588161,100407699,2016-09-09,32065714,Deborah,"The room and house are clean, well lit, and nicely decorated with plants and the space is overall cozy and cheerful. I was is Salem for a training and didn't spend much time at the house during my stay. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and close to shopping and also close to where I needed to be for training.  "
12588161,102449830,2016-09-18,48630072,Jean,I really enjoyed my week long stay with Sharon! The room listing was everything I needed for the week and Sharon was very sweet! She gave me suggestions for where to visit around the area and made me feel welcome in her home! Would definitely stay again! 
12588161,103296520,2016-09-21,1814444,Gerry,"Had a lovely stay in this cute room, equipped with fridge, microwave, coffeemaker...nice comfortable chair.  The house has a garden in back and is in a quiet culdesac. Sharon even let me use her kitchen since I can't eat out.  Thanks, Sharon."
12588161,105178430,2016-09-30,38290369,Sarah,Sharon's place was cozy and she was easy to coordinate with. I would definitely come back and recommend to friends!
12588161,107490586,2016-10-10,56533486,Connie,The room is cozy and clean with a nice walk-in closet.
12588161,108303156,2016-10-15,39473268,Cassie,"The place was great, clean, and had more amenities than I expected. I appreciated the coffee, breakfast bars and oatmeal, microwave and refrigerator. "
12588161,127477873,2017-01-18,103110718,Joe,"Great place Sharon is super nice and makes you feel right at home. Easy to navigate around town, close, but not too close to main roads."
12588161,136282945,2017-03-09,51022540,Jimmy,Great location. 
12588161,147806879,2017-04-28,62931692,Eric,"Immaculate and caring host.  Quiet and clean.  Close to shopping, restaurants and downtown Salem.  TV, fridge, microwave and Keurig and access to WD made stay enjoyable and a lot better than a hotel.   "
12588161,185767694,2017-08-22,108159755,Ty,"What a great place to stay for the 2017 total solar eclipse (or anything else that might bring someone to Salem)!  Sharon's backyard is private and even were it not for the eclipse, it would've been a great place to just hang out and relax.  The home's location is very convenient to all sorts of restaurants and shopping.   

Inside, the bed and comforter were amazingly comfortable.  The bedroom is very private and the small refrigerator in the large walk-in closet was very useful.  The desk in the bedroom provided a nice work surface and the power strip was conveniently located on the desktop (no bending down below the desk to plug anything in).  The wi-fi worked flawlessly.  The bathroom was very clean and  functional, which to me, is one of the most important factors in any rental.  It is not an en suite bathroom so guests to Sharon's home will also use it but it sure seemed that her guests were very considerate and I could leave my toiletries out.  A Keurig coffee maker with a wide variety of coffee pods was a very welcoming touch.   

Of course, Otis made the stay even better!"
12588161,214890370,2017-11-26,93425251,Mary,"Perfect situation for me as a healthcare traveler.  Sharon was open, friendly, and willing to visit without making me fell obligated to do so.  Lovely clean home with lots of thoughtful touches in the closet and bathroom for guests."
12588161,220301767,2017-12-21,9784246,J. Kathleen,Clean and convenient to downtown
12588161,232670525,2018-02-05,136145074,Marissa,"I stayed at Sharon's place for a month. It was was nicer than I expected and also very comfortable.  She literally had everything you would ever need either in the bedroom or bathroom.  The mini fridge in the closet actually fits more than it seems but beware, the freezer temperature doesn't seem to be even. Not all my stuff was frozen.  But if you don't need it and you're there for a short stay, the place is fantastic.  It was also cheaper than a lot of other places in Salem."
12588161,232896998,2018-02-07,53870257,Clyde,"Booking with Sharon was hassle-free, and she was very responsive with communication. I would definitely book again with her."
12588161,271259687,2018-05-31,36017760,Caitlin,"Had a great stay with sharon, she was super accommodating with anything I needed. The walk in closet has more than enough room for my things, which was clutch as a travel nurse. And her dog is so cute!"

12588161,320345559,2018-09-08,42508389,Thierry,"My son Jerome make an internship  in Salem for 2 months  and stay on Sharon  home. He had a nice room well equiped,  with a  bathroom  and a free access to the kitchen ; Sharon even  provide him a bike to go to work . It was very usefull  and Jerome was really happy to stay there 2 months in such good condition.  Thanks Sharon"
12588161,325786734,2018-09-20,124037494,Brenda,"Sharon’s place is in an ideal location. Five minutes drive to great stores & plenty of restaurants, coffee shops. Another 5-10 minutes takes you to downtown Salem. Her street is nice & quiet with ample parking. She has a nice garden to sit in & catch some rays.
 The bed is very comfortable & the shower is great.  Good work  space & a walk-in closet which serves as a tiny kitchen/dressing room. There is a microwave , refrigerator & a large cabinet yet still plenty of room to hang your clothes along with a good sized shelf for toiletries, etc.  
 Her cute dog Otis is a mighty little watch dog but sweet as can be. He just minds his own business.
I recommend Sharon’s place, she is a fine host."
12588161,333072959,2018-10-06,212973616,Cornelia,"Sharon is an awesome host. I'd give her 6 stars if I could! Her home is stylish and upscale and she was quick to respond if I ever had a question. I felt like I was staying in a Paris boutique hotel. I really appreciated the many thoughtful extras like fluffy towels, comfortable bed and pillows, keurig coffee setup and walk in closet with mini fridge. The location is super convenient and just a short walk or drive to grocery stores and many restaurants. I will definitely stay here again."
12588161,336805823,2018-10-14,67670780,Rd,"Sharon’s home is in a nice and quiet residential neighborhood. The house is warmly decorated and very clean. The guest room is quiet and comfortable with a small fridge, microwave, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, and a Keurig coffee machine (with a great assortment of coffees).
Sharon communicated quickly with me and was very accommodating. Sharon is a friendly and unintrusive host. I would stay here again."
12588161,416653664,2019-02-24,146989516,Alina,"Sharon has been an absolutely amazing host! Communication and check-in were prompt and easy. The home was extremely nice, clean, and the location is perfect. My room was completely cozy with all the best amenities— smart tv, coffee maker, mini fridge, large closet, and the list goes on. This has been a great experience during my extended business trip and truly has been home away from home!"
12588161,443292897,2019-04-25,134970208,Michael (Mike),"Sharon was a super curtious hostess and her place ie very much a home away from home, very quiet and peaceful, great amenities, and fantastic location- close to everything. I'd stay again!"
12588161,447507139,2019-05-03,212973616,Cornelia,Great location and hospitality. This is my second stay and just as great an experience as the first time!

12588161,473523179,2019-06-21,156247370,Leslie,Sharon is a great host.  The room and the house are squeaky clean and her dog is fun to play with.  The location is great as well.  I definitely recommend her to anyone who is looking for a good centrally located place to stay in Salem.
12588161,476645156,2019-06-26,233747282,Vikranth (Vik),Second time staying here. Just as great as first time. Highly recommend
12588161,479366458,2019-06-30,158914136,Elena Rae,"Immaculate small room with a very comfortable double bed, nightstand, armchair, small desk, coffee service, microwave, small fridge, fast internet, and TV (I didn't use it; don't know what it was connected to). Sharon provided dishes and utensils, and several useful desk items. The stylish hall bathroom provided a nice shower with a low tub."
12588161,501530542,2019-08-03,30711709,Lalonde,Sharon is a great host who made me feel warm and welcome. Her sweet home is very cosy and clean.  I spent a wonderful time there. I recommend this place for everyone.
12588161,513611788,2019-08-19,30700016,Eileen,"Sharon is an excellent host, and the property is conveniently located close to the main streets in town while at the same time situated in a quiet neighborhood. The room and bed was very comfortable and included many extras, like a coffee maker with a great selection of coffees, a microwave, refrigerator, and dishes and utensils. Everything was squeaky clean, too! Highly recommend."
12588161,515988465,2019-08-23,206955340,Marian,Cozy and quiet and very clean space. Close to downtown and campus.
12588161,520561653,2019-08-30,62677069,Katherine,I was taking some classes at Willamette University and was so grateful that Sharon’s place is open. She was willing to loan me a bike and I was able to coast the 1.7 miles into class with no hills and no worries. Saved me paying for parking and just the stress of commuting in general. Internet was great and aally needs were met. She was super flexible and And will totally try to stay there for future classes.
12588161,576892321,2019-12-14,264875933,Omar,Nice and clean place
12588161,584234427,2019-12-29,64247451,Miranda,"I’d give 10 stars if they let me! I travel A LOT, and Sharon’s place is one of my top favs now! Such a welcoming hostess and Ottis is fluffy awesome

A gorgeous home, sparklingly clean, and lovely decor greets you. All of the thoughtful touches in the room made me feel like I was staying in my own hotel room, just better! Super convenient location to top it off. I will happily book this stay again for my next OR trip"
12588161,598687447,2020-01-27,317238155,Catherine,"Can't go wrong with this airbnb! Quiet, easy going, and convenient. I would definitely stay again."
12588161,631701320,2020-06-23,173828247,Colby,Amazing host! Very clean home. All the amenities you can imagine. Would recommend to anyone.

12588161,700475568,2020-10-14,371169348,Hatem,This house is very clean and Sharon is an excellent host
12892550,74353360,2016-05-15,292546,Adam,"I came in late, and it was easy to check in and find my room. The house and room were clean and comfortable. It's a quiet neighborhood, about a 20 minute walk downtown if that's your thing. I would absolutely stay with Nick again!"
12892550,74617775,2016-05-16,72006496,James,Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Well worth the price of rental. 
12892550,76543501,2016-05-28,73396741,Julie,"This place was extremely clean and comfortable, and convenient to the downtown area and the highway. Cute, quiet neighborhood. The owner was available to me by phone. The wi-fi did not work, which was a bummer, though the owner offered to drive down from Portland to try to fix it (which I said wasn't necessary). I used the kitchen freely and left it as I found it. There were four rooms being occupied upstairs, and the walls between rooms were very quite thin. This wasn't a problem for me, because I sleep well regardless, but I could hear the voices of others quite clearly, and this might bother other people. A great price for a simple, no-frills, comfortable, safe stay."
12892550,77026436,2016-05-30,71880027,Jessica,"This place was great! It was easy to get the keys to the house and the room I stayed in had a lock on the door for extra security. The neighborhood was mature, felt really safe and parking was readily available. The bed was super comfy and made for a good nights rest. The other areas of the home were updated and welcoming. Everything was so peaceful that I found myself sleeping in, which I never do. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
12892550,77598140,2016-06-02,7801884,Brigitte Biggie,"Nick is super awesome and flexible! We got the room about 4 hours before we were checking in. He also gave us some suggestions of places to visit nearby. The room is clean and tidy, the shared bathroom is nice and has everything I needed."
12892550,78999036,2016-06-10,75633552,Praveen,"Nick is a wonderful person, Was very co operative when i mentioned about some concerns and he took care of those issues pretty fast.  Very good home with all the amenities."
12892550,79587774,2016-06-13,76668980,Kay,"We did enjoy our short stay here.  It was our first experience with airbnb.  It will be fun to pass on info to our kids, and keep in mind when we have guests who need lodging in the Salem area.  Thanks, Nick, for making us feeling welcome.  It was good to talk with you by phone. :)   

PS  We came late both nights and left early, so no time to enjoy downstairs which looked pleasant and comfy. :)  The beds were comfortable.
"
12892550,80979120,2016-06-20,74185509,Derek,"Living at Nick's is similar to how I would live at home:  clean, comfortable, and convenient.  He is easy to communicate with and respond in a timely manner.  The neighborhood is friendly which is minutes away from the Landcaster Mall and downtown Salem!  Sure I would recommend staying at Nick's when visiting Salem. "
12892550,91499259,2016-08-05,74185509,Derek,Nick's house was enjoyable to stay at that I decided to extend my stay.  Easy to communicate with!  
12892550,92227585,2016-08-08,16581757,Gary And Debra,"The house is located in a residential neighborhood of northeast Salem, only a few miles from the State Capitol.  The room I rented was clean and airy, and the bed was comfortable, but overall it was pretty sparsely furnished.  The photo in the listing doesn't look like the room I stayed in.  Also, I didn't see any evidence of air conditioning, as stated in the listing. The bathroom across the hall was very large and nicely updated.  There is a shared living room and dining room, which no one seems to use, and a nice, fully-equipped kitchen.  There are 3 separate Airbnb rooms in the house, but I wasn't sure if they were occupied during my stay.  Nick doesn't live in the house, so we didn't meet in person, but he was very responsive by email and answered all my questions quickly.  Overall, this room provides basic accommodations in a good location at a good price."
12892550,100601865,2016-09-10,90868929,Brian,I never had the opportunity to meet Nick. We talked by phone on my arrival and he basically walked the house over the phone. Enjoyed my short stay. The breakfast recommendation Nick left on the desk was definitely a winner
12892550,100703289,2016-09-10,94224058,Brandon,"Excellent place, great value. Enjoyed it and would certainly stay here again."
12892550,101308472,2016-09-12,94067531,Leticia,"This was my first experience with AirBnB. My sister and I stayed at Nick's place for 2 nights. Nick's response was fast despite our last minute booking! Instructions were very clear and we really liked the ""treating it as a hotel"" vibe. All the essentials were provided which was really nice! I also liked the space and freedom of the house (even though we weren't there during the day to enjoy it). We were able to arrive late and also cook our own eggs in the morning! :) Very comfy bed and I especially liked that I had a work space to do some homework, studying, and get work done. The only thing I was a little self conscious about was the cracking noise on the wood floor when I would walk around my room late at night and to the bathroom. We hope we weren't too loud for our neighbors. Would definitely recommend Nick's place for anyone looking for a nice, clean, private, and quiet place! :-) "
12892550,103652383,2016-09-23,1343066,Moses,Stayed at Nick's beautiful home. Everything was as described in this quiet neighbourhood and he was very clear with instructions on where everything is as well. I will stay here again soon. Thanks
12892550,105185073,2016-09-30,25011371,Jason,"Great spot to crash for a few days. Quiet neighborhood, good location, spacious and comfortable room. There were a few other people staying there at the same time, which occasionally got a little hectic, but we enjoyed our time here overall."
12892550,107686976,2016-10-11,12481126,Gene,"This is an AirBnB income property and the home owner does not live here.  It is a very nice home but I prefer staying at people's homes with them....""home away from home"" feel like a important to me.  I am not familiar with how to distinguish whether or not a house is an income property or the actual owners live there....I'll investigate this more on my end."
12892550,108133509,2016-10-14,21704821,Ditte And Steve,"I will not recommend this place. The listing did not clearly state that there are multiple rooms (4?) being rented out. When we were there, all the rooms were occupied (not all through AirBnb, according to the labels on the doors). We could hear the floors creak, the doors open and close, people talking, and TV.
This places allows instant booking but when we arrived, the room wasn't clean from the previous renter. Nick told me where to find the sheets and towels, but the linen closet was empty. He told me to look in the dryer. The dryer was packed with sheets and towels, still wet, and already smelly from having sat there for a while. I emptied the dryer then dried 1 sheet so we could sleep. If we hadn't been so tired, we would have moved to a hotel."
12892550,108620080,2016-10-16,17721132,Tomás,"Nice clean room - in a nice clean house. Close to Willamette University. We had a fun time visiting our daughter on Family Weekend at the university.

If you want to have a clean convenient room in a nice well kept house you can't go wrong."
12892550,109153472,2016-10-19,46253682,Rick,Great guidance on how to find and get in to the place.  Being on business travel I especially appreciated knowing a late arrival was not a concern right away.  A great central location.  Take him up on the restaurant he suggests for breakfast - they were great.  (though now I've forgotten their name).  I will certainly be back.
12892550,109457381,2016-10-21,36572113,Michelle,"I was in town for a conference, and so I was at the house very little. I just needed a clean, comfortable place to sleep, wash up, and eat a meal. This host provided all of those things. Very comfortable bed!"
12892550,110500800,2016-10-26,44289987,Allie,The house is shared with two other airbnb rooms so it runs a little bit like a hotel. I really appreciated that I had my own room key and the bathroom had a a privacy lock. Everything was clean and well-kept and I had everything I needed. This was the perfect no-nonsense place for business travelers such as myself. I hope to stay here again soon. 
12892550,112043575,2016-11-03,76303109,Ingeborg,Large room with great workspace and plenty of power outlets.
12892550,113024846,2016-11-09,36164027,Jacky,This was my second time staying at Nick's Airbnb and it was just as great as the first time! The house was clean and the amenities were perfect for a business traveler like myself. I love how he has washer and dryers for his guests to use; a major perk for travelers who travel often. I've already stayed twice and would noy hestitate to stay at Nick's airbnb in the future!
12892550,113792175,2016-11-13,103033289,Tj,"Nice house to stay, lots of conveniences available and makes it very easy to carry on as you would in your own home."
12892550,114327372,2016-11-17,62488411,Devin,It worked out well. 
12892550,116450699,2016-11-30,104537665,Denny,"It's quaint and delightful!  ""Experience a bit of older Salem in an updated, uniquely classy, fashion."""
12892550,120773301,2016-12-11,99561817,Magali,"Great house, nice room. Quiet and clean..would definitely stay again."
12892550,122733942,2016-12-25,63401663,Estela,The place is more beautiful than the pictures. Very spacious and warm. Host was very nice and made sure i had what i needed.
12892550,123993267,2016-12-31,99561817,Magali,"Great place, beautiful home, terrific hosts. "
12892550,127057366,2017-01-15,3053884,Jane,Very convenient for business travel. The bed is really comfortable.
12892550,127599854,2017-01-19,3529894,Kris,Nick's place was quaint and clean. It was great for me. I was there for business and was looking for a nice place to sleep and work a bit. Check in and check out were super smooth. I stayed for 3 days. I heard another person once or twice but I didn't annually see anyone. 
12892550,127877504,2017-01-21,99561817,Magali,Great place..cozy and clean.
12892550,128956820,2017-01-28,36164027,Jacky,"Consistency - that is what you get with Nick's house. This is my third stay at Nick's and it is consistently great for the value. For the value, it's hard not to stay here. I will definitely return and will recommend others too!"
12892550,129824515,2017-02-02,56518,Greg & Xintong,"Very clean, comfortable room and house is convenient location to central Salem.  Hosts kept me well informed about check-in and access to home."
12892550,132075784,2017-02-15,20755548,David,"Beautiful house, very clean, nice and quiet neighborhood. Walking distance to a nice park, 5-10 minute drive to downtown Salem and I-5. Great place."
12892550,132926386,2017-02-19,102013679,Terry,Great place to stay! Very nice home with lots of room.
12892550,133959955,2017-02-25,74235905,Barry,This house is a neat classic. Very clean and quiet. The bedroom we stayed in was very roomy and clean. Shared bathroom but we didn't see the other guest. Will book again!
12892550,135877518,2017-03-06,102013679,Terry,Very nicely updated older home close to downtown
12892550,136277749,2017-03-09,18832753,Marjorie,"This is a good value and the house is in a very nice neighborhood. At the same time, it was like staying in a do-it-yourself boarding house, since the hosts don't live there. If you are hoping to meet your hosts or be in a place that feels like a home, this one isn't for you. If you are a do-it-yourself type, Nick's place has large rooms with comfortable beds (at least, mine was), large clean kitchen and clean bathroom."
12892550,136606457,2017-03-11,6456920,Mary,Great Value.  Very quiet.
12892550,137316455,2017-03-14,18607360,Meridith,Very clean and nice!
12892550,138375424,2017-03-19,117988840,Carlo,"House very clean and quiet. Booking process streamlined and easy. Nick made it easy for us to book at the last moment!
Comfortable room "
12892550,138815259,2017-03-21,49097256,Kari,We enjoyed staying at this house. It is in a very nice quiet neighborhood! The location is great when one has business at the capitol. We would like to stay there again another time.
12892550,138979860,2017-03-22,61161134,Angela,Nick's place is very comfortable and clean. Nice neighborhood. I recommend staying there.
12892550,139119706,2017-03-23,9565393,John,Easy and comfortable
12892550,140236780,2017-03-28,1783635,Desey,Nice quiet stay.
12892550,147998935,2017-04-29,102013679,Terry,Have stayed at Nick's place several times and would recommend it to anyone.
12892550,149532911,2017-05-04,119141200,Benjamin,"This is a great place to stay for anyone whether you're visiting Willamette University, taking a family vacation, or you're just looking to relax. The home was very quiet, quaint, and clean. The owners were very polite and professional. I would recommend this place highly to anybody and would definitely stay here again. "
12892550,149982363,2017-05-06,3169138,Jean,"The place is clean but there are several year-round renters, and none of them were asked to represent the host, whom I never met. So hospitality was lacking - no instructions even for making coffee."
12892550,151437451,2017-05-12,835914,Lois,"Super quiet, lovely neighborhood, spotlessly clean.  I didn't meet anyone in person, but it was exactly what I needed for a conference.  I took Amtrak from Portland to Salem and there were plenty of local buses near the house to get around while I was there. "
12892550,152319321,2017-05-15,118563981,Caroline,"Overall, after the initial issues with the check-in information and wifi, we had a nice stay at this location. It was very clean and comfortable and mostly quiet. The hosts were fairly easy to contact and were responsive to problems. I would encourage others to stay here, but would highly recommend contacting the hosts ahead of time just to double check that all information provided is correct and up-to-date."
12892550,154479371,2017-05-24,31416038,Matthew,The house is very nice and clean and is the perfect location. Check in / Out was very simple and the host was reachable and communicated quickly with me. Wish my stay was longer - definitely would suggest this home if you are staying in the area or just want a jump off point for Oregon travels. 
12892550,154702488,2017-05-25,100121606,Abby,Loved it!!!
12892550,156209608,2017-05-29,73253672,Michael,Peaceful home in a beautiful and historic tree lined neighborhood of Salem. Great rooms with well equipped and up-to-date accommodations. This is a wonderful house with very clean and nice sized rooms when looking for a quiet stay. Great location with easy access to Salem and the surrounding areas. Plenty of on street parking and easily accessible. This location is highly recommended and includes all the friendly conveniences required for a very comfortable stay.
12892550,159858448,2017-06-11,106768421,Mengyao,Convenient location for a quick trip to Salem!
12892550,161899263,2017-06-18,19046260,Mary,"This was my second stay in this lovely historic home. Very convenient check-in process. It's a big house with multiple rooms for rent and I could hear one of my neighbors watching a movie kind of late, but nothing some ear plugs couldn't fix. "
12892550,162875918,2017-06-22,1472057,Alyssa,"I had a quick stay in Nick's place but it was more than adequate. The bed was very comfy for my tastes. It had a big desk that I could do some last minute work on. It also had a printer (I didn't look to see if it had paper) that was available. The WIFI internet worked great. Being that it is an old remodeled house, it looks to have the original wood floors which definitely are noisy when any of the house guests walk around, but it was quiet otherwise. I would stay here again. Thanks Nick and Julia."
12892550,164318218,2017-06-27,42098278,Richard,"Great place! Clean, quite, and comfy "
12892550,165094565,2017-06-30,607628,Jen,"Staying at this peaceful, spacious & perfectly located historic home in Salem was very enjoyable. 
Nick & Julia promptly handled all communication with great kindness, and check-in was easy.  
The house has everything you need, beautiful living & dining rooms, a fully equipped kitchen, huge bathroom, very comfortable beds, and even a wonderful porch swing. There's the added pleasure of occasional other friendly guests to chat with, as well. I highly recommend a stay here.  "
12892550,166870783,2017-07-04,39761869,Michelle,As other reviews noted there several rented rooms. The bathroom is shared with all renters. Everyone stayed in there room with the door shut and we didn't know who else was there. The house was large and in a quiet neighborhood walking distance to some downtown places. We only had 1 towel for 2 of us for 2 days. For the extra person fee and cleaning fee I expected plenty of towels and a spic and span home. 
12892550,170103342,2017-07-14,22585584,Lynette,There were some cleanliness issues (dirty dishes in cabinets- old food in bedroom mini-fridge).  Host sometimes difficult to get in touch with.  But nice house in convenient area.
12892550,174100217,2017-07-24,8899621,Thomas,Comfortable bed. Good temperature when room AC run.
12892550,178547580,2017-08-05,617641,Mj,Nice place 
12892550,180232204,2017-08-09,10190140,Harley,"This was a terrible experience.  We texted early in the day with our ETA, but got no response.  After we arrived, there was no host, no direction or instructions, and a lock box on the front door with no code.  We spent 45 minutes on the porch in the hot sun, exhausted from a 10-hour drive and no way to get in.  Finally, after many tries, we found a code in the AirBnB pages, but it did not work.  We called and texted the hosts numerous times with no reply.  Finally, we called AirBnB, who kindly put us up in a hotel, but it was some time before even that was sorted out.  (A shout-out to Jonathan at AirBnB for excellent service and follow-up, though.  Thanks!)  Only after we were in the hotel did we get a response from the hosts, which was far too little, too late.  This was my first ever bad experience on AirBnB.  I would not risk booking with these hosts again."
12892550,185100705,2017-08-20,74605911,Oliver,"Tolle Unterkunft, großes Zimmer, nah am Stadtzentrum und ruhig gelegen.
Habe hier eine tolle Zeit gehabt."
12892550,190973798,2017-09-05,15967960,Sybille,"Overall a great experience! Spacious, nice house, with a big kitchen. Close to the fairgrounds, where I was working. Quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend this place."
12892550,192677063,2017-09-10,145543862,Meg,The room was very clean. I didn't see one single person while staying here! So it was really quiet. Bathroom was clean. Had everything I needed. Definately reccomend!
12892550,201702150,2017-10-08,96094273,Gloria,My husband and I appreciated the value and location of Nick and Julia's home -- close to campus and walkable to downtown. The living space was clean and comfortable (once we got past the initial snafu of an incorrect lockbox code and could get into our room). We would definitely consider returning here.
12892550,202328004,2017-10-10,147980489,Tonnie,Beautiful quiet house. Very clean. Nick answered questions quickly. I would stay there again.
12892550,207691590,2017-10-29,6889516,Matthew,"Easy check in. Nice big, well furnished, common area inside and large fenced area. Quiet house while I was there - felt like I had the place to myself."
12892550,209732018,2017-11-05,24125502,Alyssa,Nice house with welcoming host. Thanks for a great stay!
12892550,211419228,2017-11-12,157719561,Erik,"First Airbnb exp and it won’t be the last. The house had everything I️ needed,bed was comfy and WiFi was fast. Great experience thank you."
12892550,223820466,2018-01-01,26498121,Nicole,"Julia & Nick were available, helpful, generous and kind! The house is spacious and nice and clean! Great value. Really glad I found them so last minute on New Year’s Eve!"
12892550,226108051,2018-01-08,17851518,Sara,"The house has been recently remodeled and is kept clean. The common living areas are very spacious but rarely used. The two people who live here full time stay in their rooms, more like a hotel or boarding house. In fact, I didn't meet anyone until I was leaving (the system is set up so that you can get and return your own keys and are not reliant on an in-person host). It's only 1.5 miles from Salem Hospital so the location was ideal for me, and it's bike-able."
12892550,231359958,2018-01-31,8337549,Will,"Quick, enjoyable stay. Highly recommended!"
12892550,237377715,2018-02-22,9412171,David,The best thing about this place is the huge downstairs living room and kitchen. This space is shared but it is expansive.
12892550,243645922,2018-03-16,14088238,Britta,Great stay for a quick work trip to Salem! The room was big and clean and quiet! The surrounding neighborhood is safe and I felt secured.  Nick and Julia were more than accommodating as my work schedule changed multiple times and so I had to alter my reservation multiple times. The other residents were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be staying again on my next trip to Salem!
12892550,247197542,2018-03-27,28985508,Tatianna,"Beautiful old house! Very easy to check in and the permanent residents were helpful when we saw them. Had a few minor glitches that Julia cleared up quickly. The single bathroom got pretty busy at times but not a surprise. Much like a boarding house/hostel set up which I think is perfect for young travellers or passing through. I missed meeting up with a host and learning about the area, but that is just my preference."
12892550,249744240,2018-04-02,181684746,William,The regular or permanent residents who are not hosting can be an issue. The property is fine if you can share space.
12892550,256391966,2018-04-22,174277500,Christopher,"This experience was upsetting. This listing is a bit misleading. It is NOT a private room with a private bathroom as I was made to believe, but more along the lines of dorm living sharing a bathroom with 4 other rooms. This wouldn’t have been too bad had the toilet not look like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks! Covered in pubic hair and urine. This wasn’t the only thing unclean. Dust and cobwebs covered the halls, bathroom, and our room. When we arrived, we could not get in with the codes on AirBNB. The hosts did not send us check in information and the codes they have on AirBNB do not match. This, of course, is after I was in communication with the host all day about a check in time. It was more important that I come after 5 than receive the code and key to my room. When we got into the room, one of the two beds was not made and there were NO extra pillows for the second bed, even in the spare closet they told us we’d find them. 

In summary: misleading listing description, Incomplete communication, and unclean and unmade room. 

We will not be returning."
12892550,257584722,2018-04-26,144711218,Lee,Solid value.
12892550,261057596,2018-05-05,21822808,Jesse,"Nice, clean and simple. Recommended for anyone who needs an easy stay in Salem."
12892550,264758120,2018-05-14,183242127,Rena,"It's a nice old house and a comfortable place to stay.  There is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, but it worked out."
12892550,269725055,2018-05-27,167962260,Sarah For David,"Very well located tidy, and well thought out home. The kitchen and dining area combo is delightful. We really appreciated having our meals there and visiting with a few friends, cozy!"
12892550,271942575,2018-06-02,21507183,Breeanna,The place was nice and comfortable. Two thumbs up!
12892550,278762527,2018-06-18,192149288,Jonathan,"Wonderful. Quiet. Peaceful, as advertised.  Good price. Easy and simple. Just great."
12892550,279802299,2018-06-21,100341668,Chris,"Great place that has self check in, which I really like. I've stayed there before and had a great experience."
12892550,291436561,2018-07-15,196672702,Brett,"Convenient, quiet, spacious place with lots of extras. Bed is super comfy."
12892550,292342821,2018-07-17,11281997,Pete,"The place was reasonably clean for my tastes. Check was simple, nice quiet neighborhood. There were parts of the bedroom that were a bit dusty. I am not a clean freak so the dust did not bother me except when I had to climb under the desk to plug in the AC unit. To get the AC unit to plug in just right was quite the ordeal. Once I finally figured it out I slept well. "
12892550,295095342,2018-07-22,102433836,Whitney,"Older house in a great location in Salem, OR. Don't be fooled by the outside of the house, inside the house is nice. Not too far from anything I went to, walkable to some things, and easy to get to/from house. The self check-in/check-out was handy since I arrived really late and had to leave really early. Julia was very quick to respond to my inquiries, so even though she wasn't there if you need anything, just let her know. For a solo traveler, it's like a hostel house so I just used it as a room for sleeping/showering when I wasn't out and about. The house has large rooms and large common areas, so there's great potential for good times if you can book as a group."
12892550,297801963,2018-07-28,166194783,Sayarah,"My grandma and I booked this place last minute and we were very excited about someone actually being able to host us on the same day. As soon as I requested the booking, it was accepted and paid in full. I sent them a friendly message for the last minute-ness about it and went on our way. At check in time we arrived to the house and rang to doorbell and stood outside for 5 minutes waiting for someone to answer. I then read that I was supposed to get a message about a key box and how to open it, which I did not. I though, “no big deal I’ll just have to call them and ask for it over the phone”. I called both of the numbers provided on their page and not only did they not answer a single call, each call went straight to voicemail. I was kind of annoyed as this point but I was giving them the benefit of the doubt and gave them time to call or message back. After two hours I still had not heard anything back from them and was getting really anxious about if I was going to have a place to stay that night. I tried calling again, straight to voicemail. At this point and I’m beyond livid and call Airbnb themselves and demanded a full refund. They told me they had to give the hosts 45 minutes to respond to Airbnb before they could refund me. Shockingly enough, they didn’t respond!! I was able to get a full refund because of Airbnb’s great customer service. Don’t ever stay here. The hosts are unreliable, unprofessional and clearly don’t give a damn about having a reputable business. I bet they won’t even respond to this review "
12892550,306593513,2018-08-12,7318639,Ida,Centrally locates in Salem. Very responsive hosts! 
12892550,310666287,2018-08-19,167313686,Shelby,Great place for a short stay. Very close to downtown Salem and a very well kept house. Host was accommodating and gave good food suggestions. Would stay here again! 
12892550,312578204,2018-08-23,97575226,Amy,"This is a lovely renovated house. The hosts were clear communicators. The place was immaculately clean and the items for guest use were clearly marked: utensils, cookware, Kuerig and coffee pods, dishes and flatware, extra towels in the bathroom. There is a comfortable living room, dining room, laundry and kitchen with nice appliances for guest use The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood. The hosts say this in the description but really pay attention to the part about shared bathrooms. There is one half bath and one full bath for 5 rooms.  I would stay here again.  "
12892550,318887684,2018-09-04,17622764,Jeff,Nice house could use another bathroom
12892550,324315298,2018-09-16,167676576,Reene ♡,"100% super great, bed was very comfortable, great location, nice quiet neighborhood with pretty trees, definitely would love to stay again!"
12892550,324746465,2018-09-17,121348283,Lawrence,"Overall a good stay; however, if sharing a bath room is a problem, this isn’t the place for you. I just needed a place to rest my head, so perfect for me. The overall all feel is that of a rooming house, but very clean. Big shared space and good kitchen from the looks. Great location in an a tree lined neighborhood. Let your requirements guide you in choosing this place."
12892550,347094608,2018-11-10,223567009,Mrisho,The place is good the hosts are very helpful
12892550,364967729,2018-12-31,224685080,Jonathan,"Great location, wonderful amenities, beautiful home. An awesome place to stay for a weekend or a month!"
12892550,401199424,2019-01-13,3867066,Leeann,Beautiful and Charming home. The other guests were very friendly. Nice to have a washer and dryer. Very quiet and peaceful.
12892550,407323722,2019-02-01,92659973,Shikha,The best was their helfpul tenant.
12892550,411811939,2019-02-13,240480631,Lew,Very pleasant Victorian home.
12892550,454147783,2019-05-17,227544804,Marco,Perfect place to stay for a good visit in Salem
12892550,454668336,2019-05-18,252594745,Rian,Very peaceful neighborhood and clean home. Beds were comfy check-in/check-out were very easy.
12892550,455425205,2019-05-19,57824072,Barbara Lynn,"This was a lovely place to stay, but I was on a quick visit and didn't get to enjoy it much. Comfortable bed and a shared bathroom upstairs."
12892550,458975155,2019-05-26,185209314,John,Great spot! I went down to Salem for a concert and needed a place to stay for the night. Planned on this spot about a month in advance and it is as good as advertised. Great for my purposes!
12892550,488276072,2019-07-14,7872700,Stephane,"I would give this experience a negative star if possible.

I think this was perhaps my tenth AirBnB?!

My second in Oregon, and my only attempt in Salem. 

It was the worst AirBnB yet!

I have had issues with some hosts in the past who falsely represented their space, and this is the first time a host has refused to refund me.

Lessons learned: 

1) never book a last minute stay on a Friday night after you have been on the road 12 hours a day for days.  You are bound to make mistakes. 

2) Be sure and select the drop down menu to include your traveling companion, even if in your initial email you mention said companion because host might be unscrupulous and use your mistake to justify keeping your money even if you do not stay in the room.  

3)  If host is using an inferior lock box, walk away!  

4) If host hides behind email, and does not reach out to you directly when you are having issues getting in, walk away!

5) No matter how exhausted you are, and even though you have to make the bed, take the time to search the closets in the hall to find the linens you need, because even though   It smells of cigarette smoke and your companion is allergic, your host expects you to stay, or will keep your money.

Know that professionally cleaned here does not include making the bed, and that even though the room was not ready to let, said host made it available anyway because... well they need the money.

I suspect Julia and Nick are having difficulty in general as in the fews days since I tried to stay here they have rebranded their AirBnB account, from Julia to Nick and changed the photo to exploit a young child (Never a good idea), though rebranding is probably a good thing as it was not doing anything positive for the AirBnB brand as it was.

I’m still hopeful that AirBnB will see fit to reimburse me for this mistake, and that Julia and Nick will find the resources elsewhere to fix the gaping hole in the porch beneath the lockbox. 

Did I mention the hole?  

I fell in it, figuratively speaking which is why I am writing this.

I have photos if anyone is interested.

To close on a positive note... The Grand Hotel on Liberty in Salem is worth every penny.  

Head north my freinds Portland is spectacular!"

12892550,557310603,2019-10-31,25511548,Ulrik B.,I had a great time at Nick and Julias' place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located in Salem. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
12892550,563699467,2019-11-13,25620333,Phil,This is a great house in a great location. I stay here regularly when I am traveling to Salem for work.
12892550,573635603,2019-12-06,44342773,Amanda,"This house was conveniently located and the cost of the room was not egregrious.  It feels like a strange accommodation with one longer term tenant, but otherwise empty.  Because it is lived in, not all spaces felt particularly cleaned or maintained (there were dishes in the sink all week).  A lot things felt forgotten like the empty container of instant  coffee offered on the counter, the moldy coffee in the coffee pot or the pilled sheets on the bed on which previous occupants hairs lingered.   However,  I was appreciative to have access to a kitchen and the ability to come and go as I pleased.  The internet was not available when I arrived and since this issue arose the day before, I would have appreciated having been communicated that this was the case and offered a resolution.  The internet was not restored until day 3, which was rather inconvenient for me.  It is what it is and if you need an easy place to stay this should do, but I have opted for a different location for future needs."

13238464,667550512,2020-09-24,9818281,Lauren,"The House on theCorner is a lovely, warm, homey place to stay in Willamette, in a neighborhood close to the University.  The beds are comfortable with huge closet spaces and the bathroom is lovely with a great tub and large shower. I loved the book room, which is also a mini- kitchen which has books for every age and taste. The sitting area is comfortable with lots of light for reading or working on a laptop. Entrance is in the main house but isolated enough so it feels like a private entrance. Colleen made sure to let us know she was available but was never intrusive. The neighborhood is nice but you do hear the train and busses that run nearby, which was not unexpected nor bothersome. I will definitely stay here again."
13238464,668737564,2020-09-27,357705001,Desirae,We had a great time! The house was adorable and in a great location. Our hosts were so friendly and helpful! We would definitely stay here again.

We were traveling through Oregon to get to Seattle and needed to stay overnight in Salem and stumbled upon their Airbnb. They have the cutest home and the pics on here do not do it any justice whatsoever. If you happen to be in the area or need a so place to stay as you're traveling through, you must book here! Guarantee that you will have a very restful stay! Bob and Delia are very very nice folks and their place is beautiful and clean! Definitely recommend them in a heartbeat! Oh, and love their dogs! ❤️"
13620753,86929592,2016-07-18,36836983,Brian/Tina,"I was visiting Salem, OR for work and stayed five days with Bob and Delia. They were so kind and hospitable! Their house was super cute, neat and very accommodating, perfect for working ""from home"" while I was away from home. It was such a pleasure getting to meet their daughter, Vanessa as well! Not to mention, they had the cutest three little Shitzus! I would have loved to visit with them and get to know them a bit more, had I had more time. I'd definitely stay with them again when I come back! "
13620753,87889807,2016-07-22,83835172,Russell,"My wife and I stayed 4 nights at Bob & Delia's place and used it as a hub to visit different sights inland, the Columbia Gorge, Portland, and on the coast - very central!  The home is beautiful in a quiet, safe neighbourhood - felt like home away from home.  The family is lovely and go out of their way to meet your needs.  I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises!"

I couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay. The room was warm, inviting and very comfortable. Great livingroom area and bathroom as well. I enjoyed their conversation and we talked as if we've met each other before! Thanks again for a great stay and letting us drink all of your coffee!! I can't wait to come back :) Next time, I am making time for us to get out that karaoke machine!"
13620753,90459943,2016-08-01,32074463,Anne,"Delia and Bob were terrific hosts.  Communication, both before and during my stay was easy and pleasant.  Their basement is as pictured;
private, spacious, clean - with a comfortable bed in a separate bedroom and full bath, as well as a nice living area including TV and fixings for coffee, tea , snacks.  Their backyard is a lovely space to
relax.  The location is a safe, fairly convenient suburban
neighborhood of upscale homes in West Salem.  Delia and Bob themselves were the best part of my stay - they were warm, fun, and most welcoming.  I enjoyed a great breakfast with them, and homemade chicken soup on my first night there, blackberries from their garden, and their three adorable little dogs.  A stay at this lovely
home is highly recommended.

13620753,91044522,2016-08-03,3131520,Clarissa,"These two were perfect hosts! We contacted them while driving in hopes of finding something close and quick since we were on a 4+ hour drive already and we're ready to call it a night. Not only did they respond within minutes but we were able to use Instant book to confirm our stay and were enroute to their house (or a restaurant near their house for a quick bite) within 15 mins. They greeted us when we parked and showed us right to our space. The family made sure we were comfortable and no had what we needed then left us to settle in. The space is very comfortable and they offer a variety of amenities. Very thoughtful. We left after they did, at least we think so as it was very quiet upstairs when we headed out. The electronic door lock made it easy for us to leave quickly and get on the road again. Comfortable, easy, convenient and great communication. It was the perfect pitstop!"
13620753,91337927,2016-08-04,13449244,Sonia,"Our stay was very short (we were in town for a wedding), so we only met Delia, but she was extremely kind and generous when we arrived and made sure we had absolutely everything we needed.

This was my first time using Airbnb (on a friend's suggestion) and both of them made me feel so welcome despite my lack of knowledge. They were very sweet and friendly, my room was very comfy, and the location was perfect, as I had come up to surprise a friend and the house was very close to theirs. I wish I had had more time to spend up there, because I genuinely enjoyed talking to both of them. Hopefully I'll be able to stay again the next time I go to Salem!"

They warmly welcomed us the first night and checked frequently during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed.  Our bedroom, living room, and bathroom were exquisitely furnished with all the comforts of home.  There’s even a piano!  The small refrigerator and Keurig were very much appreciated.  They even changed our towels after two nights!  We came to Salem to see family and the solar eclipse, and we watched it right outside their home with other neighborhood families.  Bob and Delia made sure we were included, bringing out lawn chairs and bottled water for us.   We met as strangers but left as friends and hope our “celestial” paths cross again.  Thanks again, Bob and Delia, for making our first trip to Oregon one we’ll always treasure!"

The bedroom, bathroom and lounge space were very clean and stylish. I had to call Delia to figure out the shower - the trick is to pull on the tub faucet to transfer the water to shower - she was very nice about my inability to figure it out, lol! The bed is super comfortable too, with great fluffy pillows. I didn't use much else as I was really just there to sleep, but there's a big screen tv, mini fridge and microwave, Keurig coffee machine and comfortable seating area. Lovely place and lovely people.

They have some beautiful small inside dogs that were not in the way, never came near the guest space, and weren’t an issue at all. In the morning they did bark, but we were up at 8, so not a problem. 

Delia showed us to the space, for us situated, and was ready to offer local dining suggestions. Later we met Bob and he was just as friendly. 

Sometimes it’s nice to have an Airbnb that is separate and private, but in this case, being a guest in someone’s home was great because the hosts were so welcoming and friendly. "

13620753,279836376,2018-06-21,61106367,Cheyenne,"I never really knew hospitality like this before. Us staying at this air bnb was very last minute but I am so glad that we did it. After driving all day from Seattle we were exhausted. We were already running late arriving to Salem in the first place and I didn’t think that anyone would be awake by the time we got there since it was almost midnight but right as we pulled up Bob walked out and was ready and willing to help us carry things and get us settled. Our place was so quiet and I couldn’t even tell it was attached to the rest of the house. I only wish we had more time there but I cannot explain how much that this place was exactly what we needed. The bed was super comfortable, everything was decorated well and it was super easy and convenient to stay there. I can’t say enough about this place. If you have a chance to stay here you should!"

Bob & Delia are great hosts! The space is perfect! We only spent time here for sleeping and getting ready in the morning, and it was exactly what we needed! After you enter the shared front door, you immediately walk downstairs to a basement suite with private bedroom, bathroom, and living space area! Our hosts were easily accessible when we had questions! It was so nice to stay at their home because we felt safe with them there, but they also gave us plenty of privacy— it felt like our own home!
We’d definitely stay here again! It was very clean, so comfy, safe, warm (and cool—AC! Haha), stylish, and overall just a wonderful place. 

Thank you so much Bob & Delia for opening your home to us!!! "

I am a traveling musician and the living room area was a perfect space to write and play. The bed was absolutely amazing, I slept like a rock and didn’t want to wake up! The space was clean (spotless) and the hosts were nice enough to keep us stocked with complimentary waters! Bob and Delia were very friendly, in constant communication, and just make you feel like part of the family. You are surrounded by positive messages in the form of photos and crafts from the second you stand in the driveway, all the way until you fall asleep, which we loved.

Bob and Delia,
Thank you so much! If we come back in the area, we will hopefully be able to book with you again! Best Airbnb experience!

Their home is beautiful and the space is very private, with your own room, bathroom and living area, with a huge tv! It is super-clean and comfortable....I slept like log! I would highly recommend their home to anyone. And bonus points for their three, sweet pups! ☺️"

13620753,508975888,2019-08-13,238971339,Ken,"This was my first experience in an Airbnb. Delia was prompt and pleasant  in her communication. Check in and checkout was simple. Accommodations were private, spotless and very comfortable!"
13620753,509556835,2019-08-14,32073946,Eric,"Nice, spacious bedroom with a convenient work-space, comfortable bed. A lovely living room with a large TV and sound system. Parking is on their driveway pad and access to the room is thru the main entry to the house. There is a keypad but we were met by Bob and Delia - and their adorable dogs.  Nice, quiet residential location. It is exactly as pictured and described!"
13620753,510240201,2019-08-15,52545668,H M (Cade),"I really looked forward to writing this review because Bob and Delia's place was the cleanest, and most uncluttered, place I have ever stayed. It's immaculate and beautiful. It was like staying in a top-rated resort.

Truly, this is a place you want to book when you will be staying in Salem for a week or longer. I only stayed through the night, but it was outstanding for the low cost.

It is located on a quiet cut-de-sac, and you park in a space right next to the garage, so that your vehicle is off the street. There are plenty of directions to run in the morning, if you like to workout.

The guest area is the entire basement. You will have a private bedroom,  bathroom, and a living area. It looked like the paint was new. Flawless.

The bathroom is spotless. The shower looked like it was new, and installed the day before. 
The towels and wash clothes were high-grade. (In many AirBnB places, you get mismatched towels that were passed down through the host family.)

The living area was large and comfortable. It had a huge TV, and excellent reading material. The couch was gigantic. I was only in there a few minutes of my stay to set up the WiFi (which connected immediately.)

The bedroom featured a queen bed, a clothing rack, cabinets, and a large computer desk. There are plenty of plug-ins to charge devices. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bedding was top quality. There is a large window over the bed which allows you to be woken by natural light, if you so choose.

I did not use the kitchen area, because I was meeting a lady for breakfast, but it looked functional and well-equipped.

I talked with Delia on the phone just before I entered their place. She was easy to reach, very positive, and explained things easily. I do not know if she and Bob stayed on the property because I did not hear any movement inside the house.

I do not think you will find a better place in Salem, especially for such a reasonable price. Definitely book this property if you are staying for an extended period of time."

Salem is a beautiful city with lots of beautiful sites to see and great restaurants. The Airbnb is just how it looks in the pictures, and Bob and Delia were really nice.

We felt instantly at home as soon as we entered and really appreciated the warm welcome we received from them upon our arrival. Everything is clean and well-cared-for, and there is even a little electric heater in the bedroom in case you like being on the warmer side. We liked its central location—easy to get to downtown and other popular attractions around the city. If we find ourselves in Salem next time, we would stay at Bob and Delia’s place again! :)"

13620753,604570228,2020-02-11,45756341,Clifford,"In my opinion, this was the best rental I've had with Airbnb. This is Airbnb done right! Bob and Delia have created a space that is beautifully appointed and extremely clean. The rental included a private bathroom, living area, and bedroom--all with good separation from the rest of the residence. The bed was very comfortable, and thanks to the many wonderful, detailed, and stylish touches, I felt that I had everything I needed. When you walk into the house you are struck by the elegance of the interior design decisions throughout. Although I only needed a place to sleep, it was nice being in such a calming and special space. Due to my schedule, I only had a chance to speak with Bob, but found him to be a very gracious host. I hope to stay at this house again at some point. Bob and Delia, thank you for being such wonderful and diligent hosts!"
13620753,606037216,2020-02-15,108183605,Forrest,Great stay. Bob was very welcoming upon arrival. 10/10. Would recommend.

13620753,610109822,2020-02-23,27705401,Jeff,"Clean and comfortable place to stay.   You can definitely hear what's going on upstairs and your area isn't completely separated by a door, but overall no real issues.  Don't hesitate to book."

One thing to be aware of is there is no door separating the basement and the main floor, just a small staircase. However, the space is very clean and homey and Bob and Delia were quick to respond to any concerns and overall pleasant hosts. Comfy bed, large TV and mini fridge were appreciated. The community is quiet and feels safe. Great place to stay near Salem without having to be in the city center."

13620753,656424549,2020-08-25,317488517,Lindy,"Huge couch and giant flat screen TV were welcome after a long day of driving. Bed was very comfortable. No doors on living room so the owners upstairs can probably hear a lot but they were considerably quiet and helpful when we needed them. Bedroom does have a door, I should add. Overall a great stay in a nice, safe location."

13960938,97814528,2016-08-28,2935885,Todd,"This was a very nice house in a nice and safe part of Salem.  The room was very comfortable and they actually had two rooms and a private bath separate to the rest of the family so you felt like you had the place to yourself.  The hostess Maria thought of the little things like soap, candles, and spare toothpaste if needed, which does not happen at some Airbnb properties.   The garden was lovely and Maria made me a great omelette with vegetables from the garden and some very good coffee from Hawaii.  It felt more like a quant B&B instead of renting a room in someone's house.  I also got some great restaurant suggestions which were very good too.  I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely go back on my future trips to Salem.  Dog is a bit protective but a real sweetie when she gets to know you.  Great, comfortable place."
13960938,100495577,2016-09-09,92536463,Jose M,"-I was pleased to stay at Maria and Ed's bnb for over a week; they are friendly, good to talk to, laid-back, and trustworthy people. 
-The home was quiet, comfy and it projects its own personality full of paintings and other decoration. 
-The room and bathroom were clean and since these are situated on the opposite wing to where their rooms are, they offer complete privacy. 
-The neighbourhood seems to be secure, and there is a small park to go for a walk/run around the corner; 
-Since both Maria and Ed work in the morning I enjoyed the home for my own working and having breakfast in the kitchen or reading in the living room. 
For all these reasons, I recommend Maria and Ed's bnb. 
Best wishes, JM"

The decor and art inside is colorful and bright, I was amazed by it all as soon as I stepped inside. Plus, the  backyard and sunroom are gorgeous. They are full of flowers and succulents, and a great place to sit and do yoga or just relax. The room was also very comfortable and accommodating. My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our time spent here. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I highly recommend Maria's home!"
13960938,176408435,2017-07-30,12483136,Elsa,"We had a great stay at Ed and Maria's home. Since Maria was out of town, Ed greeted us kindly, showed us where the coffee/tea was, and even offered us a space in the refrigerator should we need it. 
Though the entrance is shared, airbnb guests have a lot of privacy as the two airbnb rooms and bathroom are in a separate part of the house. 
The home itself is beautiful-- warm colors, natural light, and lots of original artwork. The double bed we stayed in was very comfortable. Ed and Maria go above and beyond by providing extra comforts-- robes and slippers (which we didn't use, but looked very cozy), and things like luxurious lotions in the bathroom. 
The house is located in a quiet and safe part of town about an 8 minute drive from downtown Salem. I would definitely stay there again."

If she offers you coffee, tea, wine or chocolate please accept- she loves that!  The accommodations are great, almost like a private suite as the bedroom and bathroom are in a separate part of the house with a little ante room. The room is spacious and well appointed. It’s especially nice to be able to control your heat so the temperature can be adjusted just as you like it. There is plenty of space in the house where you can read and relax. As for the dog- she doesn’t bark much; just enough. Happy travels!"

Maria gave immediate response to our request to stay, she doesn't have an exact time for you to check in which is so nice because you don't feel rushed. Her husband made us feel like we were part of her family. We were invited to a party that she was hosting for her Airbnb friends and they made is feel so welcomed. Her accommodations are so lovely and clean. The extra touches of having a robe and slippers to walk around makes you feel your home away from home.

The rooms were immaculately clean and snacks and water were a welcome surprise after a long drive.  The bathroom was, indeed, private and well-stocked with necessary supplies.

13960938,619690151,2020-03-18,123967470,Pam,You will be welcomed by the sweetest pit bull you'll ever met! Maria and her family are lovely and the neighborhood is beautiful and quit.
13960938,633659786,2020-06-30,121607795,Jason,I spent a month while transitioning homes with Maria and her family. The hospitality was amazing. I couldn't have felt more welcome. The separate and partitioned living space was ideal for me. If I ever have friends come to visit in town this is where I am sending them!
13960938,638205283,2020-07-14,119353541,Jillian,"Maria’s spot with such a great find. My friend and I were pleasantly greeted as soon as we arrived, with the space being the perfect size for our short trip. Clean bathrooms and bedrooms with all the basics you would need, along with cute touches of their own decor that fits in to the Salem culture. Maria made us feel very welcome and gave great suggestions on places to visit while there. Definitely would stay again"
13960938,642332510,2020-07-25,188050890,Spicie,Very clean and Maria was very friendly and attentive.
13960938,645970451,2020-08-02,88033183,Kathy,We loved staying at Maria’s place! She was very friendly and greeted us right as we came in. Everything was clean and she was super accommodating when we had issues and even had sanitizing supplies for us to use. Our favorite part was the mini green house where she keeps all her plants! Definitely check it out when you’re there. We’ll be sure to stay here again the next time we’re back in town!
13960938,652386321,2020-08-16,44452624,John,nice and neat on quiet street.
13960938,657097973,2020-08-27,62667270,Sherri,Maria's place is an incredible value. It's tucked away on a quiet street. Maria's hospitality and communication is superb. My father-in-law really enjoyed staying here.
13960938,658706859,2020-08-30,234415033,Wolfgang,"Clean space, close to town and a lot of good food spots. Made for a great base to come to for a weekend of hiking."
13960938,660289067,2020-09-04,43350435,Scott,"Maria's place was exceptionally clean, tidy, and comfortable.  It felt like I was visiting my parents' home, without the intrusions.  The bed was comfortable, and the ceiling fan really helped cool me off.  All of this, combined with the great price, make this an excellent place to stay for a few days in Salem."
13960938,661858952,2020-09-07,13772462,Pam,Like a boutique hotel. A lot of amenities.
13960938,673020387,2020-10-10,88722291,Marshall,"This is the best AirBNB experience I have ever had. Great communication, very clean, respectful and beyond accommodating. Thank you for everything!"

14556351,104165242,2016-09-25,1291019,Willo,"We had a great stay at Matthew's lovely house. We had everything we needed and it was very clean and comfortable. We only wish we had more time to take advantage of all the spaces. Matthew was responsive and welcoming before and during the stay and offered to give us any recommendations we needed. We would stay here again. Thanks, Matthew!"
14556351,110237974,2016-10-24,49103423,Danny,"House is big and easily accommodated our party. House is clean. Probably need a shower in the masters bedroom bathroom. Matthew responded promptly when we have some issue with the coffee maker, he brought a replacement unit."
14556351,120943371,2016-12-12,95938645,Kayla,"Our stay at Matthew's was truly unique and wonderful!  As a local professional theatre company, we bring out of town talent for our productions on a regular basis.  This time around, we housed all of our out of town talent in Matthew's home for an extended five weeks of rehearsals and performances.  Salem has been having an unseasonably cold fall, and Matthew was amazing with continuing to provide and make sure that everyone was comfortable.  There is only parking space for one or two cars, but it worked out great for us.  Bus stop close by, and just a wonderful view.  The home itself is truly unique and has wonderful charm in its architecture and design.  A wonderful experience and hoping to visit Matthew again in the future with more out-of-state performers."
14556351,123799571,2016-12-30,25813622,Marlie,"Matthew's place was lovely and in a really beautiful and quiet neighborhood. He was communicative and helpful throughout the whole process. Almost all of our issues during our stay were centered around the space being a little tricky with a 2-year-old...definitely not Matthew or the house's fault! Due to the nature of the layout and the decor, I would only recommend staying with kids who are old enough to understand not touching things and who navigate stairs well. A group of adults/teens would do just fine!"
14556351,133448413,2017-02-22,117060694,Josh,Beautiful 1950 Neo-Victorian that felt like home as soon as we pulled up. Matt was a great host. We will for sure be coming back next time we are in town.
14556351,138811870,2017-03-21,42939694,Katie,The home is beautiful and within walking distance of a great grocery store and restaurants. It was the perfect location for my out-of-town colleagues to stay during their short trip to Salem. Matthew was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. We felt very welcome in his home. 
14556351,141364417,2017-04-02,17922547,Samuel,"Michael was more than acommodating.  A freash bottle of Red waiting for us when we arrived, superb location, amazing communication and a house to fall in love with over and over"
14556351,141944010,2017-04-05,36171862,Nikki,"Matthews home was HUGE and beautiful, plenty of room for 4 adults to have their own space and bathroom. We loved enjoying our coffee on the back porch in the morning, as well as the super comfortable beds. Matthew was very attentive and on site for most of our stay to help with anything we needed. I would definitely stay again for my next trip to Salem. Thanks Matthew!"
14556351,142548943,2017-04-08,119032968,Kathleen,Great home located near downtown Seattle. Matthew communicated great and the house was ready when we arrived - including fresh flowers and a bottle of wine to greet us. Definitely recommend.

Welcoming touch ! We had 6 adults 2 children and the accommodations were more than adequate the beds were comfy! Thanks for a memorable family visit during our daughters college graduation from Willamette univ 
The location was also perfect just a quick drive to everything and a walk to a playground for the kids ! "
14556351,166227644,2017-07-03,116096494,Andrew,"We had a great stay at Matthew's home.  The house was clean when we arrived and the kids enjoyed playing in the house and having their own beds for the stay.  We were in town for a wedding and the house's location allowed us to get easily to several venues, including a meal in town.  We also enjoyed the riverfront park area while we were in town.  It was a very nice stay and Matthew was a great host."
14556351,167437007,2017-07-06,98661973,Carla,"Matthew's home was absolutely beautiful. He was so accommodating, showing us around personally.

Matthew was a bonus- he was extremely helpful and a great host! I would highly recommend his property!!! (As an Airbnb host I was very impressed!) Thanks Matthew!! 
14556351,190575142,2017-09-04,111445247,Joseph,"It's definitely a cute little house. The cleanliness was sub par. There were ants all over the kitchen, left over coffee in the coffee pot the day we checked in. Under one of the beds looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a few years. A lot of spiders everywhere (which I understand you may not be able to help given there are no screens on the Windows). The toilets each had there own issues but worked overall."
14556351,192468878,2017-09-10,93221341,Anne,"Lovely house with room for plenty! The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious!  We loved the great second floor options!!   The neighborhood is quiet and close to many restaurants and freeway access.   Matthew was warm and greeted us when we arrived......and helped us out with a special request during our stay.   Great spot for a trip to Salem or nearby cities!"

Matthew was a gracious and responsive host whose hospitality helped us make the most of a trip we did not want to take- saying goodbye to a loved one

14556351,234705437,2018-02-13,166653518,Alicia,"This was a lovely get-away right in a lovely neighborhood with quiet, safe streets.  And yet, we were minutes from everything we needed to access! Matthew was super-responsive and helpful, and the house was great for our big group, with plenty of space to spread out and relax.  We really enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere to come home to at the end of our conference!"
14556351,235718491,2018-02-17,118859660,Gordon,"This is a great house to stay in, especially if you are a large family. We were in town for a funeral and found the place perfect for our needs. Matthew was great to work with and responded quickly to our needs."

The house was clean and very charming and made us all feel at home. I’m also very thankful for our host Matthew for making us feel at home and giving us tips on how to get around the area.
14556351,244464730,2018-03-18,16835448,Candy,Lovely space for a group!

The kitchen is well-equipped. I wish it hadn't rained so much, otherwise I know we would have enjoyed going out onto the really pretty porch area. We had a great time! Thank you!!"
14556351,257895760,2018-04-27,888114,Deevy,"The house was a great alternative to hotel rooms during a week-long training with colleagues. The house has four solid / separate bedrooms and a couple other less formal sleeping options. The neighborhood is really great - we were able to walk everywhere each evening after our sedentary training days.  Beds and sheets are super comfortable. House decor and structure vary somewhat from room to room; some of the bathroom plumbing shows its age. Great spot, so glad we found it and would return again in a similar situation."
14556351,260710156,2018-05-04,72564634,William /Tool Tech LLC.,"Matthew's place...Best choice for Salem, OR."

14556351,264756331,2018-05-14,113442351,Cate,Great location in a lovely neighborhood. Big Home perfect for a big family gathering. Price was quite high as it was graduation weekend for Willamette but it met our needs well.
14556351,273633876,2018-06-06,192500445,Brent,"Matt provided an amazing house with all sorts of quirky architectural details, lovely bedding and one outstanding porch for enjoying the Oregon weather. The stay was great here, Matt was very quick to respond to questions and provide suggestions and overall the experience was fantastic. Highly recommended!"
14556351,275314744,2018-06-10,15064174,Demetrius,"I woled highly recommend this home. It is in a great location with everything close at hand. The home has everything one would need for a night in, or heading out. Most of all, this home is comfortable and CLEAN."
14556351,278347920,2018-06-17,60440104,Mary Anne,"Very few homes have the number of beds and bedrooms to host my family, but Matthew's place was perfect!  We each had our own bed and only a few had to share a room.  The living room and kitchen are great gathering places.  The backyard is beautiful with all the flowers and plants.  Birds love it too!"

14556351,287893783,2018-07-08,20170611,Jennifer,"Easy entrance and speedy response from Matthew.  Heads up for those with children- 
one bed is at the top of a loft that you access with a ladder.  Super cool for older kids.  But don’t  count on using it for a younger kid that could possibly wake up in the middle of the night. We ended up having a child share the bed with parents so that he wasn’t potentially climbing down half  asleep in a dark house.  Overall, great spot with easy access to everything."
14556351,288812403,2018-07-10,19861124,Logan,Amazing house and amazing owner. Thank you so much!

14556351,335617365,2018-10-12,219178223,Lisa,"Everything and more. The host was great. There were a lot of special touches that made us feel very wanted and taken care of. As my family is ver musical, it was exciting to have the piano and guitar. They were well used during the visit. 
The house was so comfortable, an old charm feeling. When we come back to Salem, this is the first place will look at to see if it is available."

14556351,365865039,2019-01-01,22662467,Mr & Mrs,"Ages 4 - 68, our family group worked well in this home. Plenty of space. 3.5 restrooms was a bonus compared to homes we've had in the past. Christmas decorations were still up for us to enjoy and the two dining tables, plus kitchen bar left us room to leave out and work on a large jigsaw puzzle. There were plenty of dishes and utensils. The tea and spice collection was nice as well. Matthew responded promptly whenever we had a question. We enjoyed our stay."
14556351,407021009,2019-01-31,142620518,Abram,Fantastic home. Very clean and very charming. Everything you need is minutes away.

The owner went out of his way to make sure my students had a welcoming and beautiful home to return to after their long days at the Oregon State Acting Festival.  Don't bother reserving rooms at the Grand Hotel if you want an elegant home base for a Salem visit:  make a reservation at the Ben Lomond House."

The 5 bedrooms and 4 different common areas gave us room to spread out and have privacy too. The beds are super comfy, the bedrooms and bathrooms clean. Don't miss visiting the Bush Pasture Park in Salem, just one mile from the house."
14556351,493621327,2019-07-22,12202108,David,"Fantastic home, private and central to all your requirements .... great location for a wedding party who have a large family."

14556351,570504862,2019-11-29,196046349,Doris,"We spent Thanksgiving week in Salem and needed a space for 7 of us to stay (including 3 kids under 5 who needed lots of room to run!), as well as for more extended family to come and visit. This large, fun, well laid out house was perfect, and we are so grateful to have had such a lovely home in which to celebrate the holiday with family. My father-in-law who visited is in a wheelchair, and we were able to get him in fairly easily, so that he could be present and enjoy this visit with kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. So much more for the money than hotel rooms could have ever provided! The kids are still talking about ""the big house in Oregon"" and all the fun they had. We hope to be back someday! Also, Matthew was fabulous at communicating quickly and thoroughly, which made everything so easy. Thank you!"
14556351,589258608,2020-01-05,9577127,Kayla,Matthew’s place was awesome! The accommodations were wonderful! The beds were so comfortable and the house was lovely.
14556351,601133170,2020-02-02,310739629,Alan,Great home come check it out
14556351,635246258,2020-07-05,35108508,Mingma,Big spacious house but some deep cleaning is needed. There was spider webs and ants in the room. Don’t bother to look into closets to find towels or bedsheets. The house has more potential if it’s well maintained and cleaned.
14556351,640590850,2020-07-20,32710004,Lorrie,"This is a big, beautiful house to stay in! Due to Covid-19 we did most of our cooking and dining at the house, and we had everything we needed. The porch provides a lovely view and place to dine. Make sure you do note that this house does not have A/C, so it gets a bit warm during the day in the summer, but the nights are wonderfully cool. There are lots of fans in the house to help keep the air moving. I highly recommend staying here."
14556351,643424450,2020-07-27,236504255,Danna,"Such a beautiful home!!  If you have a large group this home is the way to go.  We all got to stay together, instead of separate hotel rooms.  We made some pretty unforgettable memories spending quality time with family.  We had everything we could have needed and more!  Will definitely be staying here again!  Matthew was a wonderful host."
14556351,647081843,2020-08-05,32357964,Jim,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location, has everything you need. Owner is super responsive.  Nice and spacious, and comfortable.  Back porch is awesome, great backyard. Has all you need."
14556351,651039045,2020-08-14,359038423,Lizeth,It was wonderful place to spend vacations with my family mathew was super nice and respectful  the best.
14556351,652870823,2020-08-17,286221129,Marcela,Matthew is awesome host
14556351,662173998,2020-09-08,359464552,Megan,"Great location, host was very responsive and helpful. Communication from host with check in was not correct and unfortunately the house wasn’t ready upon arrival because of it. Overall good experience and enjoyed the stay!!"
14556351,666542730,2020-09-20,57206552,Vicki,Matthew's place was just as it was pictured in the posting. It is an older Victorian home with tons of character. My 3 adult children and my grandchildren joined me and we never felt like we were on top of each other. It felt like we were gathered in a relatives home. We had plenty of towels and hand soap. My grandchildren loved the books and toys that were there. I would definitely recommend this place. Matthew happened to be there when we checked in and offered his assistance with anything we needed. The kitchen was well-stocked and we had everything we could have possibly needed.
14556351,701768868,2020-10-18,167788463,Emily,Matthew was a great host. Very responsive and the house was perfect for our weekend. Highly recommend!
14773378,99111977,2016-09-03,87762784,Ethen,David's wife greeted us as we arrived and showed us where we were staying! Very friendly and accommodating. The house is a stones throw from downtown! Excellent place. 
14773378,100702744,2016-09-10,93308873,Pete,"We had a wonderful stay with David. He and his wife, Michele welcomed us with open arms. The room and the house were very nice. They were both so accommodating, friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet. They were so accommodating and sensitive to my wife's health issues including the fact that she has a medical service dog. They gave us easy to follow directions to places to see and do in Salem. David & Michele make you feel so welcome and at home, like you're part of the family. We would definitely recommend them to anyone traveling to Salem! An absolutely excellent experience!"
14773378,101859894,2016-09-15,94799738,Charles,"The house is in a really good residential spot just off the Mission, about equal distance to four corners and downtown----without the hassle of downtown parking. The hosts, David and Michelle, were super laid back. Dropped by right after work to touch base with them only to leave immediately to join my coworkers for dinner. Didn't get back to the house until late at night but they left the door open for me! Had to leave super early the next morning so didn't get a chance to properly thank them."
14773378,103855049,2016-09-24,93667511,Yogi,AirBnB is far better than selecting a studio hotel.
14773378,105185929,2016-09-30,23969175,Judy,"David and his wife Michelle were very heartwarming hosts always ready to lend a helping hand. The room was tidy and clean for our stay with our infant. At times we would come home minutes past 8 and they never had a problem with it,  again thank you David and Michelle for hosting our stay in Salem. "
14773378,109006577,2016-10-18,98641383,Brigitta,David and Michelle were good hosts. They let us use a section of their refrigerator and freezer for food. Basic private room with bathroom across the hall. 
14773378,109625869,2016-10-22,62044936,Janet,"David and Michele are very sweet, accomodating hosts. Flexible and thoughtful regarding arrival time. Enjoyable and interesting conversation over a cup of coffee. "
14773378,110987896,2016-10-29,91885764,Jeanice,"The location was good and the hosts were nice but the bathroom was dirty. The tub did not drain and there was hair and dirt above the shower.  When I mentioned this, the lady of the house was argumentative.  At 8 a.m. there was a lot of noise and conversation, some arguing.  I will not go back."
14773378,111308211,2016-10-30,94835587,Kylee & Josh,David and Michele were very welcoming and accomodating. They made sure we had access to our room and we were able to use the bathroom right across from our room. There is safe street parking and the neighborhood seemed friendly.
14773378,113792196,2016-11-13,83892035,Abdullah,"It was good experience, clean house and respectful people. Wish I could spend more time there! But I had to leave to another place for longer rent term. "
14773378,114218610,2016-11-16,9565393,John,Good location and hassle free 
14773378,126671747,2017-01-13,2297987,Michael,very hospitable hosts.
14773378,130114438,2017-02-04,47975250,Arby,"David and Michele gave us a warm welcome even though we contacted them last minutes. (We requested booking at 7pm and checked in at 9pm the same day). We parked right in front of their house on the street. We had enjoyable conversation upon arrival. The room was private, clean and quiet. The bathroom was conveniently located right in front of the bedroom. Their 4 cats are adorable. Two of them came to sleep on our bed (we left the door open intentionally so that they would come in) . In the morning Michele kindly made us coffee snd tea. Overall it was a wonderful visit to their place and we had a good time sharing stories. If I'm around Salem I would stay there again. Thank you so much! "
14773378,146406734,2017-04-22,48206013,Charles,"Very nice people : Easy, simple , clean , and  you must be a a cat lover "
14773378,147073159,2017-04-24,11389184,Zainalb,"We stayed for  two days with David and Michelle an for us it was perfect as the house is only 2 km away from all the places we needed to go to (bicycle workshop, cafes and shopping centre). David and Michelle are good hosts who spent some time chit-chatting with us which we appreciate very much because as world travellers, we are not just interested in the landmarks, scenery and history of a place, but also in the people.
Thank you David and Michelle for making our stay a pleasant one."
14773378,150877492,2017-05-09,48443237,Marcia,"Great place if you are looking for a quiet non smoking environment for a nights sleep.  Very close to Salem Hospital and Downtown.  Very nice hosts. House is quite clean, but nothing special (if that's what you were looking for). Price is right for a nights sleep and parking is convenient.
Must like cats, they all seem quite friendly and The hosts do keep them from going into the rooms they rent out, I didn't notice any cat hair at all. However, if a person had a real issue it may not be the place of choice. The floors are hardwood which does help versus carpet."
14773378,151659883,2017-05-13,87556392,Karen,"This was great for us and Michele and David  were great hosts. 
We would us them again if we needed to stay in Salem again. "
14773378,152067770,2017-05-14,127609229,Yilin,I had a fairly good experience staying at David's. Would've been better if the shower is cleaner.
14773378,152667535,2017-05-17,65382974,Jay,"Michele is very friendly and made me feel right at home. The only thing I'd change is to have a firmer bed to sleep. But that's my preference, not a complaint. I loved ""socializing"" with the cats!"
14773378,153335943,2017-05-20,51740719,Sascha,Really nice place to stay for a few nights. Clean and comfortable. David and Michelle are very good hosts. I recommend it!
14773378,153794909,2017-05-21,34406703,Karen,Michelle was very gracious and friendly... We loved the cats!
14773378,159842808,2017-06-11,24502699,Marie,"David and Michelle have a lovely home in a very quiet neighborhood but it is accessible to many things in Salem. The room was clean and Michelle provided coffee for me in the mornings while we hung out with the cats - if you like cats - this place is amazing! If you don't like them then also no worries, as they will not go into the guest room if you shut the door. David and Michelle were both very friendly and they even texted me to make sure I was OK after I returned late at night, which I thought was very sweet. Highly recommend and would stay here again!"
14773378,163441838,2017-06-24,82684550,Jacquelin,"David and Michelle were very kind, friendly and made us feel like family. I stayed with my nephew and kitty at their lovely home.  They  let me bring my kitty Papo who stayed in our room, when they already have four  cats.  They helped us with anything we needed and took care of Papo when we went away one weekend without me asking.  I would highly recommend this Air B & B as everything is close by, nice neighborhood, and Michelle & David were wonderful hosts."
14773378,163954039,2017-06-25,65645648,Marek,"David and his wife were great hosts, we were in constant contact when it comes to my late check-in time, there was no problem with it, we had nice chats, the room was very clean and comfortable, they gave me a fan to my room, so I was very happy not to have AC. As I love cats it was nice to see how they are rumbling around. 
Read the description of the house and rules and you will know what to expect - it's very honest, the most important advantage of the perfect host!"
14773378,165696991,2017-07-01,132696992,Michael,David and Michelle are such wonderful genuine down to earth host. You immediately at home. Michelle is so helpful and friendly. David and Michelle are great people. Highly recommend. They made friends out of us.
14773378,166190617,2017-07-02,80341979,Keling,Unexpected comfortable and happiness. The hosts are very very 
14773378,167133579,2017-07-05,105651543,Shelsee,"Michelle's and David's place felt like staying with long time friends. Michelle was very helpful and several times offered to help me with my disabled son. She even folded my laundry when I feel asleep after starting it. She went out of her way to help me in the apartment search for a new home. Her cats were friendly and adorable and let my boys snuggle them. Their backyard was nice to relax in and gab with Michelle. I hope to stay in touch with them. 

Great value especially for the price. "
14773378,173133713,2017-07-22,65903309,Michael,"Friendly hosts and willing to help people in need.  Older home, but things were clean and neat."
14773378,173732505,2017-07-23,91724164,Taylina,I had a great stay with my mother at David's place! Him and Michele were very kind and accommodating. The room was nice and I had a great nights rest. Would recommend for anyone traveling and in need of a place to stay. 
14773378,176425301,2017-07-30,142522910,Diandrea,Cute little house with cool cats
14773378,183979266,2017-08-18,82721387,Rick,"My son Joshua and I stayed with David and Michelle for almost 3 weeks. They were great hosts, doing our laundry, and helping us find good things to do during our time in Salem. If you are looking for a home away from home, this is a good one in the older section of Salem. It is very fair for the price they are asking. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a very good one."
14773378,184454923,2017-08-19,143236449,Julien,"David and Michele were very accomodating for same day booking, very generous and thoughtful."
14773378,185100719,2017-08-20,94272357,Lucas,"My night at David's place was great. Though it was very quick, I would gladly stay longer next time. I had a peaceful evening reading on the back porch. The location was nicely placed just south of historic downtown and I met up with friends for a nice brunch. David and Michele (as well as their cats) were very friendly. Thank you!"
14773378,185387055,2017-08-21,1256221,James,"Great host, nice room and superb location. The only problem was the local freight trains honking their horns through town during the night - we're not used to that in the UK!"
14773378,186493578,2017-08-24,82721387,Rick,"This was my second stay, and David and Michelle treated me like a family member.  Very hospitable and warm. If I am ever on Salem again, I will certainly look them up first. "
14773378,190632747,2017-09-04,14718897,Kenneth,Gentle and kind people welcome you into their happy home. <3
14773378,192066533,2017-09-09,138838299,Emily,"David's place was very cozy with fun and quirky decorations! The cats were very sweet and not shy to come over for a pet. The walls are kind of thin, but there is a fan in the room that produced enough white noise to drown out other noise. Our hosts were also kind enough to stay awake past the regular check in times to wait for our arrival. Would definitely stay here again!"
14773378,199730477,2017-10-02,151487601,Nicole,"Awesome people, definitely come stay here!"
14773378,199982251,2017-10-03,91351348,Sharon,The place was just what we needed -- a comfy bed and a clean place to stay. Extra blankets were available since it did get cold at night and their cats were very cute. David also responds in a timely manner which I really appreciated.
14773378,212215705,2017-11-16,152404907,Nancy,"Very nice people! I enjoyed my stay here, only thing is that there are no locks on the bathroom or bedroom door."

14773378,216640339,2017-12-04,159042271,San,"David couples are very interesting people, they are friendly, hospitable, like pets, as a Chinese from me, lived here for 14 days, on November 24 with the David family had a good Thanksgiving, so I live a lifetime memorable. Because my English is not good, (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate to communicate, but fortunately the communication is smooth. I recommend to you that if you come to Salem, staying here in David is great, cheap, and nice to have."

14773378,217318724,2017-12-08,3024016,Aaron,Michelle was very nice. She was nice to talk to and would always leave our light on to our room at night so we wouldn't walk in the dark (very sweet of her). She also gave us some snacks :) (thank you!) Cats are very friendly (more friendly than my dogs!) Neighborhood was quiet. Thanks for letting us stay at your place!

14773378,291915341,2018-07-16,151583267,Lucas,David and his wife were amazing people and were able to accommodate me last minute. David's place was a very close drive to the capitol building.

14773378,295961191,2018-07-24,33458462,Carolyn,"David and Michele were very friendly and wonderfully welcoming.  The house is very accessible (one mile from my office--oops!  1.6 km!).

David took my reservation on very short notice and accommodated my special needs (extra rinse to sheets and towels because of fragrance sensitivity) immediately.  

I was surprised to learn I was sharing the family's bathroom (a first for me with airbnb), but the timing worked out easily, and they were FANTASTIC about removing anything that had a chance of causing me a problem because of the fragrance.  

There isn't a better value in Salem."

The only thing we thought was weird was no lock on the bathroom door.  We just put something to block the door in case someone wanted to use the bathroom at the same time, but it ended up not being an issue.  Great hosts. Welcomed us in every time we came in.  We marked them as a favorite for the next time we visit Salem."

14773378,522937668,2019-09-02,70307261,Alex,"The place smelled so strongly of cat pee that I had to suppress a gag when I walked in the front door. In the bedroom wasn't as bad as the rest of the house. The bathroom and kitchen were both really bad.

I stayed the first night anyway because I was worried about money. I ended up leaving without staying the second night that I reserved. When I said I was leaving early, Michele was very insistent about asking if anything was wrong. I said I found the cat smell overwhelming. Michele reacted alright and said she wanted to get it taken care of, but David got defensive. It was an uncomfortable interaction."
14773378,523938672,2019-09-04,5959453,Denise,"David & Michelle live in a modest, older home in a very quiet & safe neighborhood. The house and bedroom/bathroom were clean. The bed was very comfortable. Perfect place to crash during our long drive from CA to WA."

14773378,552901273,2019-10-22,157805144,Wini,"David's place is exactly as mentioned in his add and photos. Yes there are cats in the house but I did not disturb them and they did not bother me either. Overall a good experience as downtown Salem and Commercial Street was close and also on bus route hence transportation was not a problem. If you take the Groomer Transportation from Portland Airport to Salem then it's about 1.5 mile from his place, I did not take it but saw people who did. He communicated promptly to all my questions. Let me use his kitchen which was great. Great people to know and stay with."

14773378,599022309,2020-01-28,312932148,Valerie,"Hello, I stayed in this ai (Website hidden by Airbnb) months roughly. Michele is great. But David is very disrespectful, argumentative, and invaded  my privacy. I decided to leave this air b n b before my reserved  stay was up. This was because he was very nosey, disrespectful and believed that even if I rented the room he could go in at any point for whatever he pleased. I wasn't able to open my window because they had heater on even tho my room got no heat. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. They are not even refunding my days I am not staying. Very unprofessional. Very inconsiderate."
14773378,604880660,2020-02-12,331475789,Anna,"Second time staying in a bnb, David and his wife were easy to communicate with, very kind, and welcoming people. Their home is beautiful and the decor is peaceful. Located in a nice neighborhood. I'd definitely request a stay in the future!"

14773378,659474803,2020-09-01,124326142,Regan,"David and Michelle are more than considerate. I wasn’t sure how long I planned on staying, and I initially only booked one month. They blocked out 2 months in advance for me on the chance that I needed more time, without any extra money on my part. They helped with my laundry and dishes, and were always incredibly kind whenever we talked. Staying here was a blessing I didn’t know I would receive, and their cute little kitties made it extra fun! Their backyard is sunny and beautiful, and sitting around the fire pit and night is great for stargazing. Would stay here again for sure!"
14773378,660654530,2020-09-05,331475789,Anna,"David & his wife are pretty awesome people! This was a 2nd time couple stay at their home, everything about them and their home is welcoming, communication is great, and the bed is super comfy! Thank you again!!"

The house is beautiful built in 1903,with early 20 century (Website hidden by Airbnb) sets on 2 beautiful acres. I've  already booked a 2nd stay. When I am in that area that is where I'll stay. Thanks Elizabeth for making me feel so welcome

15272064,108640031,2016-10-16,98945325,Robin,"This was our first stay with an Air BnB and we found the perfect place and host to stay with.  Her home is lovely and Elizabeth did everything in her power to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  Even Chloe (the dog) and the cats were well behaved and made us feel they were glad we came.  We had told Elizabeth that this was an anniversary trip and she even put flowers and candy in our room for us--a very unexpected surprise!  She said that she is looking forward to decorating the house for the holidays and we hope we can go back to see it at that time of year.  We can't recommend Elizabeth and her home highly enough.  We felt like we were visiting an old friend and enjoyed talking with this intelligent and well traveled lady.  The room was clean and comfortable with a TV and internet access.  There was a coffee maker and small fridge in the room.  The bathroom also was clean and had everything we could ask for in it.  And the gorgeous turquoise tile floor was so shiny, we kept thinking it was wet.  We truly had a wonderful, relaxing stay. "
15272064,109948010,2016-10-23,53038188,Kathie,This is a beautiful place to stay.  The atmosphere and our host were extremely warm and inviting.  We hope Vista Manor is available for our next stay in Salem.  Thank you Elizabeth!

The room was very spacious, had a lovely fireplace that Elizabeth already had a nice fire going in for me, a private bathroom that was directly attached to the room & the bed was a king sized slice of heaven that I just melted to sleep in. Everything was beautiful, clean & smelled wonderful. She also had nice little soaps & toiletries available. I was bummed that my stay was so brief, would have loved to explore the house & property more. It was conveniently located to town but felt nice and private. Anyone who stays here is in for a treat! "

15272064,117239530,2016-12-05,17249050,Ms. Kyle,"Elizabeth was the perfect host! My daughter stayed the night prior to her LCSW test, and Elizabeth was so gracious to understand that my daughter needed to just study...and Elizabeth even offered her own, naturally lit office for my daughter. The location is perfect~close to stores and a park, but it feels like you're in the forest. The lovely bedroom was tastefully decorated and had the most beautiful linens and towels, and toiletries in the bath. Elizabeth even provided a freshly washed bed for my daughter's dog...and puppy treats! My daughter felt so at-home and welcomed in Elizabeth's home, and I felt that she was in the perfect spot. She, and I, would highly recommend this beautiful home & host!"
15272064,120204985,2016-12-08,9784246,J. Kathleen,Elizabeth's home is perfectly set up for Air B&B. Her guest room is spacious and lovely as well as private. It makes a great home away from home. She currently has everything decorated for the holidays and the home is very festive and welcoming.

Elizabeth was fine with me bringing my 3 well behaved dogs and all 4 of us had a great sleep! I brought a cover for the bed since my dogs like to sleep with me, although she also offered me an option when I thought I had forgotten mine. I can recommend this place highly."

She was at work when we arrived but kept in touch and made sure we settled in nicely. Although the upstairs is a bit drafty she provided us with a space heater which got things warmed up in no time. The location is excellent - right off a main road, about 5 minutes from downtown, but it feels very private and secluded which was nice. "

Although I was only there for sleeping, I could see that the house is beautiful and well appointed. My room was very comfortable, and the bedding was gorgeous! I really appreciated all of the little amenities contained within just the bedroom space. I know that if I had stayed for longer, I would have been just as comfortable. I will definitely be staying with Elizabeth again for my next visit! "
15272064,139868316,2017-03-26,121936797,John,"To who reads our review:

I can say without reservation that this was one of the best experances that me and the better half have had in awhile. 

We took a few days to do some leisure travel when the kids were away at camp for Spring Break. 
You will not be disappointed. The house is super clean with great wood floors through out.  The rugs where warming and accented the rooms.  

All the décor matched and well it was just pleasant at every turn and room nook and cranny. 

Our room had excellent view of the garden area. 
The morning and evening light was inspiring. 

The amenities were world class and the linins were quite nice. 
The Bed made sleep easy and we both woke  up very rested and ready to take on the day. 
And the furniture in our room was just right for a short or extended stay.  
The chair by the window was relaxing and allowed me to catch up on some reading. 
The flat screen mounted on the wall allowed me to catch up on news and was the right size and was great quality. 

The home is located close to a good restaurant’s of all types.  There are a couple of places for night life for dancing jazz & rock and country all within a very short drive. 

We can both say you will not be disappointed. 

Elizabeth is a Fantastic host and the Home is full of charm and elegance!!!

J and D 
P.S. the Coffee in our room was fantastic and we know as we are coffee aficionados’

15272064,141298718,2017-04-02,68189296,Thu,"Elizabeth was an incredible host - excellent and clear communication, welcomed us when we arrived to show us around her beautiful home and provided us everything we needed. The room was cozy and comfortable with everything we needed: mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave - on par with some of the nicest hotels and BnB's we've stayed at. She has a sweet dog and some chickens in the backyard. We happened to stay with her on a weekend when she was at home and she made an incredible breakfast that she kindly offered to us as well! An unexpected treat (some of the best pancakes we've ever had), so if you happen to time it right, you may happen to catch an awesome breakfast too. We are musicians on tour, and Elizabeth even came out to our show in town and brought a friend. As a host, she went above and beyond and we highly recommend her and her amazing home if you are coming to Salem, OR! "

15272064,144090497,2017-04-14,16420508,Joan,Elizabeth's AirB&B is one of the best! You will not be disappointed with your stay. We stayed in the larger room with the fireplace and it was amazing.

15272064,146796763,2017-04-23,94874443,Larry,"The home was easy to find and priced right.  My only complaint was that the room shown on the internet is not what we stayed in.  The house has 4 rooms, 3 smaller ones, and 1 nice larger one shown on the site.  The house was a convenient location for our visit to Willamette."
15272064,147250442,2017-04-25,50323913,Kay,Wonderful house and grounds. Fabulous hostess.  fresh flowers in all the rooms! I will definitely be back.

15272064,148030190,2017-04-29,123625745,Tiffany,"Elizabeth was a very gracious host.  Her amazing home is on a quiet residential street back away from the road with beautiful trees, very peaceful.  But right around the corner is anything you could need in restaurants and stores.  The room was clean and cozy and decorated in a charming vintage style.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in!  Fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, water, coffee and tea were provided complimentary.  And the gorgeous tulips were a nice welcoming touch!  Was even greeted by the sweet puppy dog Chloe.  Elizabeth checked in via email and to make sure everything was good while I was at my conference.  A very pleasant experience for my first AirBnB adventure, will be back when business takes me to Salem again."

It was warm, clean, had everything I needed and more (as did the larger room I previously stayed in). It's a lovely vintage home within a few miles to downtown  Capitol Building, and Willamette University. Public transportation is 1 block away. I would definitely stay again!"

15272064,152280035,2017-05-15,3940843,Gemma,"Such a great experience. Knowing we'd be pulling in late,we let Elizabeth know,and even though she was working even later, she told us how to let ourselves in, and encouraged us to reach out to her, or her son, for anything we needed.
The bedroom we were in (Elizabeth has 2 or 3 rooms to rent) was small and bright with a luxurious  feel....Lovely bedding, efficient storage for Mr.Coffee, plates, cutlery, a fruit bowl,mini fridge with yogurts and waters, and a generous stash of nice products in the end suite bathroom.
The home is quiet, sitting on an acre of land, with fresh flowers everywhere. 
We caught up with our Host over coffee on Sunday morning and came away from our stay feeling we'd made a wonderful new friend. 
Will definitely  be back!"

The private bathroom is great as well. It was a lovely, comfortable stay and we would recommend it to anyone visiting Salem. "

I was traveling in from the East Coast and did not want to stay in Portland after my long flight and time change.  It was so easy to rest here before my 4 hour drive south!  My only regret is that I did not personally get the opportunity to meet my very capable host (because I was still on East Coast timing....).  It couldn't have been more pleasant or restful...."

15272064,182905650,2017-08-15,9317198,Keltha,"We had a spotlessly clean and lovely room.  Well appointed with a small refrigerator and microwave as well.  Could be a little noisy as people came and went up and down the stairs.  Elizabeth is welcoming and has a beautiful and very large home.  As she has a couple of rooms upstairs to rent, while she lives in the downstairs, there is a sense of privacy.  Centrally located and in a nice neighborhood."

15272064,185511831,2017-08-21,12885327,Qingling,"It was almost last minute when we decided to take the plunge and go to Salem for the total eclipse no matter what price we have to pay. I had been checking the listings for a while, not to mention the steep price, most places didn't look remotely like the places I wanted to stay at. When I saw Elisabeth's listing, I almost couldn't believe I would find such place at a reasonable price just 2 weeks before the event. Top reviews from many reviewers, and the place looks nice in the pictures. I wrote to Elisabeth to ask about her pet policy, and it was after midnight, but I got response back right away! And it's her communication style throughout the process, very timely response all the time!

Her place is indeed very nice, clean  and cozy room, nicely set up with everything, we even have our own small fridge considerably loaded with water. The whole place is like in a garden. Her place is also conveniently located. Everything is close by, good restaurants, Minto-Brown park... It turned out we really got lucky for being able to book her place. She was not going to rent her place out at the beginning, but due to her knee injury, she had to cancel her own plan and stay home.

Now let's get to our great experience. She had a family gathering, and we got invited to the party. We got to enjoy the company of her friendly family and also the great home-made food! I felt guilty that her family did all the work serving us... The morning of the eclipse, we were served with scrambled eggs laid by her own free-range chicken, the best eggs I've ever had. And her daughter also made delicious pancakes for us. Can't believe how lucky were are! (disclaimer: breakfast is not standard part of what you get). Our puppy also had a blast playing with Elisabeth's dog Chloe.

All guests, Elisabeth and her daughter (Melissa) went to watch the eclipse together, it was just the right crowd to share the special day with! This trip is definitely a very memorable trip for us! Couldn't ask for better!"
15272064,186859573,2017-08-25,96590879,Bettie,"Elizabeth is a fantastic host who was attentive to all our needs.  Her home is a special oasis in Salem, a fun capital city of Otegon, a great state!"
15272064,188528695,2017-08-29,23350045,Ann,Great property - nice rooms and beds with windows.  Elizabeth is very welcoming and made us feel at home.  I have found my Salem home when visiting my daughter at college.
15272064,189150899,2017-08-31,1299104,Brian,"The house is absolutely beautiful and an incredible value. Elizabeth truly makes her guests feel welcome, even going above and beyond with things like yogurt and bottled water stocked in the room."
15272064,189417652,2017-09-01,4525216,Nicole,"A wonderful place for the night - we arrived late, around 11pm and it was absolutely no problem - Elisabeth greeted us and over a wine we chatted until midnight, Liz even offered us to use the hot tub. The room was lovely, even with coffee, tea and a fridge with fruit and yoghurt and breakfast items for the morning... - We will come again for sure, thank you for opening your house ..."

Elizabeth's place was perfect...from fresh flowers, expansive amenities, cleanliness and a most comfortable bed.  The bathroom was bright and cheery with plenty of everything in case you forgot something.  Loved the bathroom floor!  Elizabeth's responses to any of my questions before arrival were immediate.   It was great having a beautiful outdoor space to use also.

The value was exceptional.  Highly recommend Elizabeth's place and would definitely stay there again."

15272064,210496760,2017-11-09,31674102,Anne,"I would HIGHLY recommend Elizabeth’s home for a visit to Salem. As I have used airbnb for numerous trips --- from France to San Diego --- I can honestly say this was one of the best airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. Communication prior to my arrival was timely and welcoming. When I arrived, I found her lovely estate to be exactly as pictured. My room was not only clean and comfortable (the bed!), there was a broad selection of complimentary toiletries in the bathroom (thank goodness, because I had forgotten my toothbrush!). I found a basket of fruit and a vase with fresh flowers on a tiny desk where I was able to set my iPad to catch up on some work. My room’s “mini-kitchen” had a refrigerator (with yogurt and other items stocked), microwave and coffee maker; yes, there also was freshly ground coffee in the cabinet, tea and oatmeal packets, along with dishware, glassware and utensils --- everything one would need for a short or extended stay. During my visit, each day my dirty dishes, which were set out on a hallway tray, magically returned to the spot, clean and ready for the next use. Elizabeth and her son, Chris, were so helpful in responding to my every need and made me feel like a welcomed guest in their home."
15272064,219759921,2017-12-18,134587312,Belinda,"I loved the extremely comfortable bed, the plentiful & delicious coffee and the room temperature which was perfect for me! I appreciated that you had the room stocked with extra toiletries including makeup remover wipes, packages of tissues, etc. I look forward to booking my Vista Manor room on future visits to Salem, Oregon."
15272064,229635695,2018-01-24,32930889,Cindy,"Great place, great host! Everything was perfect, so glad I chose to stay at Elizabeth’s. I will definitely stay here again if I get the opportunity!!"

15272064,233242366,2018-02-08,1320855,Jean,"Beautifully maintained mansion from maybe early 1900s.  Original hardwood floors, immaculately maintained features.  Great bed with view of large old trees and sky.  Greeted with fresh cut flowers in the main living room/parlor and bedroom. Glad the host has kept this gem in the condition it deserves.  Quiet neighborhood too, easy few minutes to the Capitol."
15272064,234182244,2018-02-11,139884325,Jeff,"Great central location just south of downtown. Very nice home and accommodations, and lots of small thoughtful touches that make a difference. Also, excellent communication from the owner."
15272064,234702339,2018-02-13,149886017,Blain,"Elizabeth was a fantastic host, going above and beyond in proving small comforts. This rustic house has been imacuatly maintained and has neat aesthetic features. I loved the bathroom tiles! Our stay was very comfortable and we would recommend Elizabeth's place to everyone."

I will absolutely be staying with Elizabeth again."
15272064,236893000,2018-02-20,40104763,Ann,"We have stayed at Elizabeth’s many times. She is always very welcoming and is happy to see us. Her rooms are clean, well equipped, and always cozy."

15272064,243973523,2018-03-17,120218023,Katy,"The house is a gem. We had everything we needed and even some extra surprises, like fresh flowers and fruit. 
The house was so clean for an older home. But we loved the unique atmosphere and the runner Ducks in the back yard.
We will stay again."
15272064,244515207,2018-03-18,172371693,Sophie,"Very stylish, classly, clean place! Elizabeth was very kind and quick to respond with questions. I would stay again."
15272064,244819423,2018-03-19,137730474,Michael,"Elizabeth's home was the perfect place for us to recharge during our hiking trip. The room was stocked with plenty of amenities and had its own coffee maker. We were also quite surprised and intrigued by the animals that roam around the property: cats, dogs, chickens, ducks...they were extremely friendly and made us feel at home. Most of all, Elizabeth was extremely gracious and accommodating. She happened to be absent from the property during our stay, but was quick to respond to questions and gave us clear instructions for check-in. We would highly recommend staying with Elizabeth if you plan to travel through the area and need a quiet, homely retreat."
15272064,245066413,2018-03-20,117546524,Jordyn,This home was quiet and beautiful in a perfect place downtown Salem. I recommend staying here when you need a place :)

15272064,247501462,2018-03-28,18347116,Kathleen,Elizabeth is a wonderful host. She went out of her way to accommodate an earlier check in! Her home is lovely and the accommodations were squeaky clean! Wonderful stay thank you so much Elizabeth!

15272064,249771383,2018-04-02,3053884,Jane,"Any of the rooms in Elizabeth's house are comfortable, clean, and cozy. It's my home away from home when I travel to Salem for buisness."

15272064,250947903,2018-04-06,166086633,Cassie,The room was very nice for the value. We aren’t savvy Airbnb”ers”? Haha. So it has been a new experience and this space was delightful. And the fact that she allowed dogs was a bonus.
15272064,254711623,2018-04-17,162708941,Laurie,"I was in and out fairly quickly, so I didn’t get the chance to fully experience this beautiful home.  However, it was very quiet, which is something I value in an air bnb. I slept soundly and woke up refreshed."
15272064,255193115,2018-04-19,40104763,Ann,"Elizabeth’s place is always a win for us. It’s dog friendly, clean, has the coziest beds, and there are fresh flowers in the room to welcome us. We stay here whenever we are in Salem."

15272064,260123430,2018-05-03,179633694,Nancy,Elizabeth has a beautiful home surrounded by trees in a residential neighborhood. I loved having fresh flowers in the room and a selection of Oregon yogurt in the fridge. I would like really like to return and stay longer the next time I’m in Salem.
15272064,261669390,2018-05-06,170822377,Christy,"We enjoyed the short walk down the hill to the Acme Cafe and Venti's for a super breakfast and dinner. My husband didn't realize that we weren't in a B&B and that we had to walk to get food!  A short walk in the other direction takes you to a little park and through neighborhoods with pretty landscaping especially in spring.

The property is a 'work in progress' as the owner works to bring it back from ivy and blackberries so you can't really go out and sit but it was really too cool to do that anyway.  I got a kick out of walking out back and checking out the chickens and rabbits."
15272064,262681368,2018-05-09,5600298,Rebecca,"This was a wonderful Airbnb experience. The bed is super comfy, the room had every little convenience including coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator. Elizabeth is a warm and welcoming host as well. She communicated very well in all aspects of our stay. I would definitely recommend this charming spot."
15272064,262979967,2018-05-10,32347162,Matt,Beautiful house and very nice airbnb.

15272064,268075065,2018-05-23,85337239,Richard,"A great host as advertised!
We enjoyed our one-night stay on our way to California.  The room and extra touches were beautiful... we had a butterfly motif.  The only thing that would have made it better was if the window's could be opened to let in some fresh Oregon air at night.  The bed was great and we slept very soundly.  And in the morning we had some organic fruit to start the day :~)"
15272064,271572944,2018-06-01,115188265,George,Gracious home and hostess - our Salem homebase whenever we come to town.
15272064,272628000,2018-06-03,46773,Kerwin,Beautiful house centrally located in Salem. Secluded woodsy feel in the city. In-room bathroom and mini-fridge were great and the jacuzzi was a delightful surprise. Glad I brought a bathing suit.
15272064,273937756,2018-06-07,57373859,Robert,Awesome place and an awesome host! Really nice and hospitable. Best part of the place was the hot tub. It was also very convenient because it was so close to the highway. Highly recommend.
15272064,274662208,2018-06-09,79861145,Kent,"Elizabeth is a fabulous hostess - great communicator, lots of loving touches at her place, and even a hot tub in which to relax after a long day of driving.  The room is quaint, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable.  I highly recommend this place!"
15272064,275374194,2018-06-10,131395016,Eric,"First of all, Elizabeth is an exceptional host. Never have I felt so welcome as a guest in someone else's home. I would stay with her in a heartbeat if in the Salem area again because of her kindness alone. She also is extremely responsive and competent as a host; has an immaculate, charming house with many great spaces she shares with guests (including a large, verdant, highly functional backyard; a pool and a hot tub; and common areas on the first floor); and charges a meager rate in comparison to what she provides for guests. Although my stay was brief, Elizabeth provided me with an unparalelled AirBnB experience that I don't expect will ever be matched."
15272064,275734040,2018-06-11,13635734,Geoffrey,"Everything was greater than I expected, simply fantastic! Thanks again Elizabeth ;)"
15272064,276109407,2018-06-12,53595624,Anna,The best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Everything was perfect!! Elizabeth’s place was warm and cozy. She really went the extra mile making me (or any guest) feel welcome with a beautiful and clean room + a nice info sheet full of tips for local enjoyment. I wish I could’ve stayed longer and will definitely stay again the next time I’m in Salem!!
15272064,280235538,2018-06-22,167309149,Diane,Very nice home. Lovely Yard. Good location. Very reasonable price. Responsive & helpful hosts. Will stay again when we are in Salem.

15272064,282965656,2018-06-28,55346071,Beth Anne,"My daughter and I stayed here for one night on our college tour.  It was a great place. Elizabeth wasn't home at the time, but it was really easy to find and check-in and check-out were self-explanatory based on her communication.  The house was really cute, as was our room.  We were so tired that we just basically huddled in bed and watched tv, but the room had all these special touches (a microwave, plates, a coffee maker, small fridge, etc) and the bathroom was full of soaps/shampoos/lotions. Also, it wasn't more than 10 minutes from downtown Salem/Willamette University/the hospital so really convenient.  Wish we had been able to stay longer and enjoyed the garden etc.  I highly recommend Vista Manor."
15272064,283330806,2018-06-29,46066136,Valerie,Very nice little room-close to everything and convenient to come and go. Elizabeth is a great host and has a very sweet small cat. Recommended for a quick nights trip to Salem!
15272064,283811256,2018-06-30,44196052,Gary,"This is a beautiful old home. It's old, but so elegant.

15272064,288452453,2018-07-09,182178253,Rebecca,Our stay was great and the house was beautiful and the land scape was spectacular. The hot tub was a great after a long week of driving across country. We will definitely be back.
15272064,288791221,2018-07-10,15099772,Coralie,"Lovely charming place and we felt very welcome even though the hostess was away.  The extra amenities were so appreciated.  The grounds are fascinating - complete with bunnies, gorgeous chickens and an friendly cat!  So quiet - no we didn't have to kill the rooster to get a good night's sleep.  Highly recommend!!"
15272064,289206781,2018-07-11,192149288,Jonathan,"Great place.  Quiet, clean, and spacious place.  Host was kind and made us breakfast.  Highly recommended.  Very comfortable stay."

15272064,291944999,2018-07-16,1120933,Valerie,"Elizabeth's home is Elizabeth's home is absolutely wonderful! We traveled for a month and spent the entire time at Airbnb, and we have to say, that Elizabeth's  is in our top three.  Elizabeth has such a caring heart and you will feel very much at home from the moment that you meet her. She seems to think of everything, all the details, all the things that are comfortable to one who is traveling.

We were traveling out to the West Coast to attend a wedding. Elizabeth's incredible bedroom suite, equipped with its own bathroom, not to mention how beautifully decorated it is, was absolutely divine for preparing for such an important event.

Do not hesitate to book this wonderful space! You will absolutely not be disappointed! Expect to be surprised and delighted by all the special touches that she provides. :-)"
15272064,293127625,2018-07-19,154366758,Jamie,This Airbnb feels just like home and is very calming. The whole property is beautiful and well kept. The room was well stocked with all essentials and the host was very accommodating. We immediately felt welcomed and noticed beautiful personal touches all around the house. Would highly recommend staying here (and the hot tub was an added bonus!)
15272064,294986746,2018-07-22,38373688,Monica,Elizabeth was a fabulous host. I was staying in Salem while I was participating at the art show. She made the stay completely worry free. It was more than I expected-the fridge was stocked with water and yogurt and milk and cereal were available. She checked on me during the show asking if I needed anything and left extra water bottles for me. I was even able to park my small trailer there. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend Elizabeth's place!
15272064,296424894,2018-07-25,153960180,Jennifer,Elizabeth was such a great hostess! Her house is beautiful and we were able to get 2 wonderful nights of rest which was just what we needed! I highly recommend her.

The amenities were spot on and the home quiet and clean. We usually just pass through Salem on our way north; but Elizabeth made us want to stay in Salem for a while. We’ll definitely be back!"
15272064,307098981,2018-08-13,196186851,Paul,"A beautiful house, with fair prices and a lovely hostess. Elizabeth was attentive and available for questions and tourist tips, without being intrusive. On several occasions, we were out of the house all day, and she emailed to make sure there was nothing we needed. She provided fresh fruit and muffins which was very much appreciated. It's touches like this that make the stay memorable to weary travellers. Thank you Elizabeth!"
15272064,308088337,2018-08-15,43728573,Diane,"The location is wonderful.  Amenities galore within a few blocks. The home itself is gorgeous, peaceful and quiet.  Super cute room, clean, nice linens, comfy bed. Great private bath with terrific water pressure in the shower .  Add to that Elizabeth stocks your mini fridge with water, yogurts as well as coffee, oatmeal, etc.  She also sets out fresh baked goods for guests!  Great working AC which was much appreciated given it was 95 degrees when we arrived.  We had the good fortune of sipping a drink by the pool and relaxing with her family.  NOW for the kicker...she welcomed our two dogs and allowed them to stay in our room.  Honestly, Elizabeth could charge A LOT more...the value is truly amazing.   We have rented from Airbnb before but always opted for a separate residence.  We are now believers in renting a room thanks to this experience.  A side note...we ate dinner at Venti's just a few blocks away and LOVED it.  "
15272064,309157446,2018-08-17,60564451,Joel,Wonderful place!  Elizabeth was awesome to work with prior to my arrival and is a fantastic host.  Her home is wonderful and the room was GREAT!  Thx Elizabeth!

Everything is clean, well thought out and she is an excellent hostess. We loved the pool, hot tub and feeding her animals. It was a very quiet, relaxing place to stay and we will definitely be back! My Daughter really wants to rent her beautiful guest house next time. =)"
15272064,312107982,2018-08-22,52542794,Melissa,"This lovely home reminds me of European B&Bs with en suite and all the little extra touches! You will be welcomed and very comfortable staying here with Elizabeth and her son. Chloe, the pup, is the sweetest girl and the cats are all such love bugs!! I had a fabulous stay here and hope to be able to book again on my return trip soon!"
15272064,312578590,2018-08-23,44098145,Wade,"Clean, comfortable, and a great location in Salem. And an amazing house. Elizabeth was a gracious hostess. Wish we had more time to enjoy pool and patio. We would readily stay here again. "
15272064,313099675,2018-08-24,55448956,Bill,"I simply cannot recommend this place highly enough! This was a place where I only had one night because my hotel room  for the remainder of my stay was being paid for. If I had a different choice, I would’ve stayed here every single night. The place is incredible! There is a swimming pool. There is a hot tub. The house is huge! The upstairs room where I stayed was clean, comfortable and had its own bathroom. Everything I needed was there including extra bathroom and toilet supplies, plus tea,  cocfee, a refrigerator and more! There is a massive backyard where you can sit and enjoy a cup of tea. Further away from the house there are chickens. This place is amazing.  Elizabeth was the consummate host. She offered me some curry that she had made in the evening and some fresh banana bread in the morning. I cannot rate this place highly enough. Run to this place! Do not walk!  10 stars! "
15272064,315029966,2018-08-27,98465993,Steven,"Elizabeth has by far the best place I've stayed at yet!

The amenities were endless it seemed! 

Her hospitality was equally endless...

I had the day before check in severely sprained my ankle, upon hearing this Elizabeth supplied me with a set of crutches...

I had dropped my phone in the pool and she quickly supplied me with a bag of rice which kept my phone in perfect condition...

The place was immaculant, with all one would find at a hotel and more!

I will definitely be staying again if I visit the Salem or surrounding area in the future!

As well I'd strongly recommend that you do the same if in the area!"
15272064,315415080,2018-08-28,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth’s is a beautiful, comfortable space.  The beds are terrific and the rooms have absolutely everything you could need—and more!  This morning, there was wonderful homemade apple bread!  "

15272064,316711826,2018-08-31,187758805,Sonja,"This place is an oasis of tranquility. Beautiful location, quiet and hotel/b&b equivalent special touches/amenities. This is the perfect get-away to unwind and recharge."
15272064,318477939,2018-09-03,31044232,Janene,Elizabeth's house is spacious and charming. We had two kinds of homemade bread while we were there that were very tasty. The location is quite good and near many restaurants and groceries. The pricing is a real value. I recommend this home enthusiastically.
15272064,319224898,2018-09-05,69469208,Lisa,Elizabeth's place is beautiful and she has everything set up so you will have everything you need to have a comfortable stay. We would go in a heart (Website hidden by Airbnb) was that nice.
15272064,320404722,2018-09-08,125587,Alda,"Gracious host, beautiful home and amenities"
15272064,321950879,2018-09-11,192630487,Marsha,Very nice. Comfortable and cozy.
15272064,322668478,2018-09-13,196672702,Brett,Elizabeth’s house is luxurious and lovely in so many ways.. We had a wonderful stay and felt spoiled with the generous food and amenities. Highly recommend!
15272064,324751224,2018-09-17,192630487,Marsha,A  cozy calm respite.
15272064,325100811,2018-09-18,145242538,Toni,We had a very nice visit albeit one day. The home is full of great character and conveniently located. An older area of Salem but walking distance to many restaurants. Our host Elizabeth went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and at home!
15272064,327327160,2018-09-23,76421279,Sara,"Really nice location - walkable to some shops and restaurants but in a more secluded wooded neighborhoods. Lots of thoughtful  touches (like lens wipes, lint roller, hair dryer, baked goods!). It's a comfortable room, with a nicely set up private bath. Perfect size for 2 people. Elizabeth, the host, is very easy to reach and responsive."
15272064,327909297,2018-09-24,79861145,Kent,"This is a nice, quiet, comfortable place.  Elizabeth is awesome - she's a great, thoughtful, caring person, and that not only is evidenced in your face-to-face interaction with her, but also in all the care she puts into the room, and the special little treats and amenities that you find while staying there."
15272064,328637757,2018-09-26,16970172,Joseph,"really nice big house , with several airbnb rooms. lots of space and  good location."
15272064,329394727,2018-09-28,24171634,Avital,"Elizabeth’s home was perfect. Great location, lots of added touches with amenities, food, dishes, bathroom supplies... Nicely decorated. Quick responses. It gave me ideas for my Airbnb too!"
15272064,330653819,2018-09-30,186946719,Vittoria,Elizabeth is very hospitable! We had a great time!
15272064,331081229,2018-10-01,74926473,Monica,"Great Stay! Little touches in bathroom supplies, small kitchen supplies, and little fridge were very nice to have and made if feel more like home. Elizabeth communicated extremely well and kept me updated on all things pertaining to my stay. Her pumpkin bread in the morning was very delicious, and she had fruit available, which was a pleasant surprise. The location happened to be a couple of doors down from my destination (wasn't planned that way) so that ended up being a great added perk. I would make a suggestion to put instructions on the Keurig. Since it was a small one, I wasn't sure if I needed to add water or wait for it to heat up. The only other thing I could have asked for were windows that opened for some fresh air in the bedroom area, but the small air conditioner was more than enough to keep the air circulating. All in all, this was a great Air B and B and should I ever travel to the Salem area again, this would be my first choice to stay."
15272064,331470947,2018-10-02,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth really is a Superhost!  The queen room has a comfortable bed, yogurt in the refrigerator, coffee, tea, oatmeal, and grits (grits! Who has grits at an Airbnb but a superhost?) to make, and more helpful amenities in the bathroom than you could ever need.  She goes beyond that, though, baking something for most mornings, and providing fresh fruit.  Truly super!"
15272064,332190532,2018-10-04,9197920,Shannon,"Great character home and area to walk into town. The nice touches of tv, microwave, coffee maker and the homemade apple bread was awesome. Also the bed was fabulously comfortable and the most important to me as I was driving from Vancouver to Vegas and needed a good sleep for the journey!"
15272064,332615970,2018-10-05,67061233,Phillip,"Easy access in & out, really nice home & easy going host!"
15272064,333028448,2018-10-06,45545855,Karen,"I've stayed at many Air BnB's and this is the very BEST!  The bed was incredibly comfortable, the sheets fresh and good quality.  The decor was very classy, charming and artistic.  The home is beautiful and clean.  Elizabeth made it very easy to find her place, she was an excellent communicator.  I felt safe, welcomed and the amenities were above and beyond.  Snacks, yogurt, many toiletries to choose from, beautiful plates, a robe in the closet, even freshly baked pumpkin bread in the morning.  It will definitely be my first pick if I am ever in the area again.  I also loved having my own private bathroom attached to the bedroom. Thanks for a great experience!"
15272064,337242649,2018-10-15,152244303,Cherel,"Lovely home, gracious hostess, perfect location for us!"
15272064,337587653,2018-10-16,100598449,Randy,This is a lovely 1920's home. The common rooms are sumptuously decorated as well as the bedroom.  Snacks and toiletries you may have forgotten are bountiful.  Memory foam mattress very soft and comfortable.
15272064,338900541,2018-10-20,137551720,Eric,What a wonderful stay! Amazing hospitality - great room - and the amenities were on target. Great value
15272064,339675132,2018-10-21,5818793,Jo-Anna & Jacob,"Elizabeth's place was even better than expected. Check-in was easy and communication was great. What really made the stay wonderful was all of the details. So many amenities, all the bases were covered as far as any toiletries or items we may have needed. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
15272064,340079236,2018-10-22,72814021,Jacalyn,"SUCH a fabulous space!! The atmosphere is welcoming and warm, and the house itself is just stunning! I can not recommend this space enough. Truly a beautiful stay. "

The room was lovely, with everything I could ever think of needing for one night. Really enjoyed the cranberry bread and coffee in the morning. Wonderful shower , comfy bed! Hope to return!"
15272064,345708684,2018-11-05,99966384,Lachlan,Elizabeth was a sensational host. Would happily recommend to others.
15272064,346438271,2018-11-08,7175062,Marsha,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful old house.  Elizabeth goes out of her way to make you feel welcome, and shows you where all the amenities are.  If the weather had been better, we would have wandered around the garden.  Our only complaint is the softness of the bed, as we both prefer a firm mattress."
15272064,346769039,2018-11-09,24636235,Mark,Really cool house.  Cozy upstairs bedroom.  Definitely a great value.  I hope to stay there when I am in town again!
15272064,347090173,2018-11-10,128010392,Sonia,Lovely house and bedroom.  Comfortable bed.  Terrific touches like baked goods and fruit plus coffee maker and microwave with oatmeal.  I definitely felt pampered and plan to stay here again.
15272064,347761957,2018-11-11,146547822,Tuang,"Loved Elizabeth’s amazing vintage property, it’s one of the nicest places we’ve visited. The room was comfy and the private bathroom was charming. There were abundant pastries, fruits, and waters right outside the room and coffee and tea in the room. Very helpful when you were hungry and wanted to grab something small. The toiletries are appreciated. I was very impressed that she has shower caps and disposable makeup removers for ladies. Thank you very much!"
15272064,348169186,2018-11-12,225295554,Vikki,Beautiful house with comfortable bed and amenities. We would certainly stay there again when in Salem area. Host was welcoming and helpful.
15272064,348430838,2018-11-13,15090402,Gwen,"Great accommodations, everything anyone could possibly need. Great communication with the host. Comfortable bed and great location!!"
15272064,348662673,2018-11-14,2618453,Josh,Great room with very comfy bed and en suite bathroom. Elizabeth was gracious and helpful with getting the hot tub ready and providing neighborhood tips. Lots of small touches and nice amenities. Would definitely stay again.
15272064,349508798,2018-11-17,143933436,Amber,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Wonderful location and excellent value. The space was clean, many amenities, and exceeded my expectations."

15272064,351715603,2018-11-23,7776457,Phil,"Elizabeth has an amazing, comfortable house and adds great touches like homemade carrot muffins or banana bread. Highly, highly recommended!!"
15272064,352085914,2018-11-24,69316053,Wendy,"What a beautiful place.  Elizabeth greeted us at the door. Everything had such love in all rooms.  The bed was so comfy like it was giving you a hug with memory foam mattress and a down comforter. The shower is very tall and my husband loved it.  She had all kinds of extras in room like qtips, makeup remover. There was fruit out in Hall way and then she made homemade Apple muffins. yum. you can use the hot tub if you want. The yard is so awesome to sit and relax on if you want a fire or by the pond. We will absolutely be back."
15272064,352725251,2018-11-25,21986970,Patrick,Great value.  Really a gem.  Would love to stay again.
15272064,353175026,2018-11-26,48826403,Harsh,Elizabeth was the best host I've ever stayed with. She took care of everything that we required and had almost every amenity necessary and more in the room. The house was lovely and the whole experience was excellent.
15272064,353381037,2018-11-27,15090402,Gwen,Fantastic place again! I will certainly come back!
15272064,354994156,2018-12-02,47721524,Jonathan,"Elizabeth really takes the Bed and Breakfast concept to heart! The house is stately and beautifully furnished, on a gorgeous tree-lined property.  It's like a homey getaway in the midst of a commercial area just off a major through way. Self checkin was a breeze with a digital door code. The rooms are cozy,  with a plush bed and private bath featuring plush towels and a hot shower along with plenty of shampoo, conditioner, and body gel.  But it's the little details that set this Airbnb apart; the room has a mini fridge and a microwave right inside,  with plates and silverware.  There is a Keurig machine with a generous selection including chai and hot chocolate along with bottled water. Instant oatmeal was available in the room,  and right outside,  Elizabeth provides a daily rotation of fresh fruit and home baked breads (she made banana, pumpkin, and pear breads during our 2 night stay! All were delicious). Really an above-and-beyond experience especially considering the reasonable rates. I couldn't recommend it higher."
15272064,355375239,2018-12-03,76806844,Cassie,My stay at Elizabeth’s place was excellent she was so friendly and it has everything you need. Definitely would stay again.
15272064,355584159,2018-12-04,15090402,Gwen,My 3rd time here and as perfect as always!! There is nothing lacking ever!
15272064,356263650,2018-12-07,22781463,George,"Very clean, charming residence.  I highly recommend it."
15272064,357594659,2018-12-10,153781977,Heidi,Elizabeth's home is beautiful and very comfortable.  We loved the freshly baked sweet breads every day!  Very nice neighborhood and an easy 10 minute drive to Willamette University.
15272064,357811922,2018-12-11,15090402,Gwen,Perfect in every way as always!
15272064,358245094,2018-12-13,209580974,Steffanie,"My wife booked this first AirBnB stay for me while on business in Salem. It proved to be a positive experience and pleasant stay. Thought I didn't cross paths with host Elizabeth while there, she has put thought/effort into the hospitality and amenities she offers."
15272064,359382180,2018-12-16,3925319,Michelle,Vista Manor was just beautiful and Elizabeth was an extraordinary hostess.  I highly recommend this booking.
15272064,359962677,2018-12-18,173688803,Glen,Elizabeth is a fantastic host and her place is beautiful! All the little extra touches make your stay special!
15272064,360792623,2018-12-21,227556702,Raymond,"My stay was very pleasant. Everything was as advertised and I had my own room key. Elizabeth went above and beyond with little extras (including any amenity you may have forgotten to pack) and fresh baked goods and fruit. There was a Keurig (with coffee and tea), mini-fridge, microwave, and all the kitchenware you’d need to eat/drink with. I would definitely stay again.

While I didn’t take advantage of it, there was also a hot tub and some animal companions to keep you company if you desired."
15272064,361082355,2018-12-22,123662558,Greg,"Elizabeth is THE Rock Star of Airbnb hosts!  She met me at the door with a pleasant smile and introduction. She gave me a tour of the space made available to me in her beautiful character rich home which was built in 1923. Her place creates a warm feeling with its hardwood floors, leaded glass windows, wood moldings, and period correct furnishings incorporated into the architecture. In my large bedroom, Elizabeth showed me the refrigerator stocked with yogurt and bottled water. In a basket she had popcorn,  oatmeal and other goodies ready to bring to life in the microwave. Also available was fresh fruit and small loafs of homemade spice cake which compliment the coffee I made with the K-cup single cup coffee maker in my room.  I found the memory foam bed to be luxurious and most comfortable with its comforters. Once thoroughly informed of what was available to me, Elizabeth reminded me of the hot tub located outside in a totally private setting under the majestic evergreen trees. Before I went to bed I totally unwound and relaxed, as I enjoyed a soak in the 104 degree water. I trust your stay with Elizabeth will be as memorable as mine! Greg Smith"
15272064,361560899,2018-12-23,194401501,Mike,We had a wonderful stay at this property. The house was as described and check-in was easy. Elizabeth was very fast to respond to my messages and ensured we had a peaceful stay.
15272064,362162207,2018-12-25,157068619,Leah,What a wonderful home. You can tell its an older styled house and the decor matches perfectly! Elizabeth was supper sweet! We had a small mix up but she handled it like a pro! Deffenitly coming back!
15272064,364975877,2018-12-31,47639265,Sharon,"This room with a private bath provided everything we could have hoped, and more.  Elizabeth was responsive and helpful; the space was lovely.  We will definitely visit again."
15272064,365840412,2019-01-01,103782627,Brittney,Cozy place to stay!
15272064,366561339,2019-01-02,227556702,Raymond,This was my second time staying and everything was just as great as the last time. There was nothing I was left wanting for. I would stay again.
15272064,366998544,2019-01-03,9565393,John,comfy sleep in lovely house
15272064,367405086,2019-01-04,227556702,Raymond,Another great stay at the Vista Manor. Everything is as described and has great extra touches for anything you may have forgotten to bring. A great location for local shopping and eating as well. Highly recommended and would stay again.
15272064,368419510,2019-01-06,211258681,Jeffrey,"Elizabeth home and property are beautiful she's exceptionally, accommodating and considerate. we highly recommend staying at this home"
15272064,404612645,2019-01-24,190305250,Tina,"Elizabeth’s place is great. I booked one of the rooms for my Mom. She was comfy and cozy and well cared for. Fresh muffins, fruit and bottled water available everyday. Beautiful private grounds and lovely manor house. Elizabeth was easy to get ahold of and quickly responded. I will definitely book with Elizabeth again"
15272064,405830648,2019-01-27,33244277,Kristen,What a wonderful and relaxing place to stay Elizabeth had thought of everything. I highly recommend this Airbnb gem. 
15272064,408546884,2019-02-04,182178253,Rebecca,Elizabeth's house is amazing and I definitely recommend it. The grounds that the house sits on are beautiful and it's in a great location to get around the Salem area. We will definitely be back.

15272064,415847828,2019-02-23,224149270,Jenny,"Elizabeth rolls out the red carpet for her guests. Her home is sparkling clean and if you have forgotten anything, she has a basket of amenities to help. She provided fresh baked goodies, breakfast and snack items and our room even had fresh cut flowers waiting for our arrival. We didn't have time to explore her grounds, but the home is lovely and I'm sure the outside is just as welcoming and enjoyable. The home is also very convenient to many eateries and downtown. This is a jewel! I suspect we will stay here again when we visit next."
15272064,416612769,2019-02-24,244073766,James,Very nice
15272064,417276934,2019-02-26,15090402,Gwen,"This is the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in.

15272064,419372012,2019-03-03,33244277,Kristen,"This is my second stay at Elizabeth’s place. Every comfort is available, and every need attended to. I will definitely stay again if I need a place in Salem."
15272064,420163085,2019-03-05,66824877,Rosa,Beautiful home and perfect room. So many added touches which I loved! Great location and value. I definitely recommend! 
15272064,420786641,2019-03-07,215944918,Genesis,"Elizabeth’s place was one of the best BNBs I’ve been to! From the easy check-in, quick responses, communication, and THE most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, it was all perfect!"
15272064,422290024,2019-03-10,85979192,Tara,"Vista Manor is amazing. Elizabeth had her co host take care of things, so we did not cross paths but she answered all my questions. Her place is above clean and quiet. I am working on my writing so I needed a quiet place. It was perfect. The room is cute and had ALL the amenities and then some. I will be back again."
15272064,423318183,2019-03-13,32095394,Angela,Great place! Nice extra touches. I may be back!
15272064,423615892,2019-03-14,183933479,Kimberly,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host and provided a great place for a very good price. As a woman traveling alone, I felt completely safe, and the space was quite comfortable. She had some beverages and light snacks in the room and the fresh flowers made me feel like I was at home. Very convenient location to downtown. I would highly recommend."
15272064,424386435,2019-03-16,79861145,Kent,"Elizabeth is very good and seasoned at Airbnb-ing!  I have stayed with her several times, and each time is better than the one before - she is always tweaking and improving the living arrangements!  Hot tub is a nice bonus!  The only warning I would give you is that (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps is funky in her area, so actually look for Vista Avenue and turn there - then (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps seems to recalibrate and get you there!"
15272064,426037105,2019-03-19,147436110,Pablo,Elizabeth was an amazing host. The room was clean and the bed was great. I got a great night of sleep. The location was easy to find and the house is beautiful. I know where I will stay if I am ever in the area again for work.
15272064,429372770,2019-03-27,246875716,Kelly,Great spot. Very convenient and comfortable.  Plan to stay there in the future.
15272064,433104813,2019-04-05,56646427,Laura,"Elizabeth was a big help with getting to know Salem. Her place was beautiful and she had lots of nice, personal touches. Her family members were also very helpful and polite. The location was central to everything in Salem. I would recommend this place to anyone."
15272064,435203608,2019-04-09,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth is absolutely the perfect host, and her home is a wonderful place to stay!  I'm usually in the room with the queen bed, sometimes the room with the king, but this stay was different.  I had reserved the queen room, but when I showed up at 1 a.m., Elizabeth came outside to greet me--the people who had stayed there before had used lots and lots (and LOTS!) of cologne, and she wasn't sure that she'd been able to clear the room of the scent.  (I'm terribly vulnerable to migraines triggered by fragrances.)  So we checked out the room together, and after I was leery about staying there all night, she put me in the guesthouse--a much larger place with a VERY COMFORTABLE king bed and kitchen!"
15272064,436723964,2019-04-13,100063603,Shanti,"Elizabeth's antique home is clean and comfortable. She goes out of her way compared to other Airbnbs I've stayed at to provide baked goods, water, oatmeal, and fruit. There is a thermostat and heating unit in the bathroom which is also in the room so that you have control over the temperature in your space. She provided extra blankets, towels, and a Simple Human dispenser in the shower with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. She offered access to the hot tub and the room locked from the outside with its own key. The check in was easy. The location is great, only minutes from many parks and perfect for us since we woke the next morning and headed to Albany."
15272064,437440868,2019-04-14,31688370,Greg,We would definitely stay there again:)
15272064,439284109,2019-04-18,57820866,Jeanne,"A beautiful home, both stylish and comfortable, with a kind and caring host. I felt warmly welcomed - Elizabeth really attends to detail, with everything from fresh-baked goodies and fresh fruit to a drawerful of supplies in case you forgot something! For animal lovers there's an opportunity to snuggle up to a very sweet doggie; if you don't care for animals, no worries as they are not in airbnb territory unless invited. Truly a home away from home."
15272064,441295712,2019-04-21,235328689,Ashley,Thanks for the stay! It was very lovely and accommodating! Made me and my girlfriend feel right at home. Loved that it was cable tv in the room as well and en-suite bathroom the room. Loved the window view in the bathroom as well. Close to nearby food places and Walmart.
15272064,442566262,2019-04-23,15090402,Gwen,This is the best Airbnb in Salem!
15272064,442921620,2019-04-24,36721490,William,This is a very private and comfortable room in a lovely home. Elizabeth is a warm and gracious host who has added some very thoughtful touches. Add to this the short distance to the capitol district and you have the perfect place to stay in Salem.
15272064,443294115,2019-04-25,222115190,James,"Excellent service and a beautiful place to stay, highly recommend"
15272064,446110720,2019-04-30,14469309,Fitz,Wow!  The first AirBnB that genuinely felt like a BnB.  Common areas were truly inviting.  Hot Tub! Fresh baked goods! Also close to tons of restaurants both familiar and adventurous.  I went to Venti and had a Thai peanut rice bowl with Korean BBQ tempeh.   Sure why not.
15272064,447455273,2019-05-03,102911339,Justin,Amazing place to stay. Basically like staying in a hotel with twice the amenities and little touches. Elizabeth is a great host. Highly recommend stayong here!
15272064,448956145,2019-05-05,58087684,Brenna,Perfect place to stay!
15272064,449459476,2019-05-06,40104763,Ann,We have stayed at Elizabeth’s place many times and have enjoyed each time! She is warm and friendly and her home is so cozy. The beds are wonderful.
15272064,450578994,2019-05-09,57820866,Jeanne,"I just love this beautiful home, a gorgeous Tudor style home with wood floors, oriental carpets, pretty finishing touches and a lovely shaded yard. And the many ways this host provides for guests - wow! From fresh-baked sweet breads and bottled water to all those little supplies you might suddenly find you need (from toothbrush to sewing kit, etc) - she's got you covered. Easy 2 mile trip into downtown for work. Makes my work travel so comfortable..."
15272064,451434190,2019-05-11,4057216,Meredith,"We love staying with Elizabeth. Her house is welcoming, quiet, and full of flowers and animals. When we were there were 8 ducklings that just hatched! It was the best to see them walking around. Our daughter loved it. We'll definitely be back."
15272064,452288387,2019-05-12,235023667,Cody,We came to Salem for a show at the Elsinore. Elizabeth was nothing but helpful and accommodating. The hot tub felt amazing and the property is very centrally located for all our needs. Definitely recommend.
15272064,452741724,2019-05-13,172154991,Tracy,"My daughter and I only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed a week! Elizabeth's house is beautiful and our room was absolutely amazing. I could spend all day in her back yard. If you are an animal lover, this is the place for you. Elizabeth was an amazing host and I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Salem. I highly recommend Elizabeth's place if you need somewhere to stay in Salem."
15272064,453062362,2019-05-14,15090402,Gwen,"Best place in Salem!
As always everything was perfect"
15272064,453789649,2019-05-16,134799166,Sungjin,It was cozy and nice! I liked that there is mini-refrigerator at the room.
15272064,456513558,2019-05-21,105367491,Sharon And Todd,"What a fun place to stay in Salem. A spread as if on a country farm, while sleeping in a well appointed and comfortable home. I especially enjoyed sitting in the hot tub toward the end of a long day."
15272064,457246894,2019-05-23,260076710,Carter,"This was my first ever Air BnB, but I have a hard time believing that anything could ever top this. Not only was Elizabeth an incredible host that prepared fresh banana bread and fruit for all her guests, but she also provided coffee, easy breakfast options, and a memory foam mattress. I slept better here than I do in my own bed. Also, the backyard is full of plants and a beautiful garden that is incredibly serene. I could not recommend this place enough!"
15272064,457702780,2019-05-24,6393277,John,"It doesn't get any better than this. Everything was really 5 star. Elisabeth met me when I arrived, showed me my very cozy room and an amazing array of little extras. I was very tired from a long day. I took an inviting shower and snuggled down among the quilts, propped up on several pillows and watched a little TV and fell fast asleep. Everything was perfect."
15272064,459788754,2019-05-27,95215310,Denise,"This is a charming, pristine clean, grand old home— wood floors, comfortable bed, a refrigerator stocked with yogurt and water bottles and a coffee maker in the room; muffins and fruit available for breakfast. Elizabeth has thought of everything a guest could possibly need.  If the weather had been nicer, we would have loved to explore her beautiful garden. This home is a rare and wonderful find... our best yet through AirBnB!  Hope to return!"
15272064,460657969,2019-05-29,57820866,Jeanne,"Such a cute, comfortable hideaway! I couldn't help but think how my kids would have loved coming here when they were small - with the pool right outside the door - and what a great romantic getaway it would make for a few days with my sweetie, exploring wine country. But in this case I was a business traveler; the peace and quiet, access to a full kitchen, and space to do my stretching / yoga were all a perfect antidote to a hard day of work."
15272064,461035821,2019-05-30,67759397,Bill,Couldn't be nicer.
15272064,463043341,2019-06-02,109184685,Deona,"Elizabeth's place is warm, inviting and so comfy.  Homey environment but plenty of privacy, too.  The perfect Airbnb."
15272064,464090725,2019-06-04,128439980,Lubor,"Probably the best accomodation I have ever visited. Equipment included in our stay: HotTube!, Cafee machine with lot of capsules for both cofee and tee, homemade bakery in the morning."
15272064,468505389,2019-06-12,48520707,Gwen,Elizabeth is a gracious host.  We were greeted at the door when we arrived and she would chat with us when we saw her and make sure we had everything we needed. The grounds are lovely with lots of trees and beautiful flowers all around.

15272064,472048932,2019-06-18,10913395,Brad&Val,"This was a perfect one-night stop on our way from Tacoma to Ashland. Elizabeth has thought of everything to make a traveler's stay comfortable, including a wide variety of amenities in case anything has been forgotten.  The microwave and coffee maker in the room were just what we needed.  Lovely neighborhood with parks for walking, plenty of places to choose from for meals just a short walk from the house."
15272064,472469140,2019-06-19,17930551,Nicholas,"This retreat surprised me! Tucked just beyond a main road, the property is a relaxing escape from the bustle, while still conveniently accessing the grocery store, dispensary, restaurants, and a couple bars. Elizabeth was very welcoming provided anything I could want, and the hot tub was a perfect end to my night. Would highly recommend."
15272064,472972170,2019-06-20,57820866,Jeanne,"I love this clean, quiet, totally comfortable hideaway. With fresh fruit, eggs from the backyard chickens, and home-baked goodies waiting for me - its unbelievably welcoming."

15272064,477718992,2019-06-28,36879734,Jennifer,Elizabeth’s home is beautiful and spacious with abundant shared space. The bed is super comfortable and the space is equipped with every amenity you could want. I especially enjoyed the home baked breakfast items and Elizabeth’s thoughtfulness.
15272064,478272543,2019-06-29,257355344,Brittany,Great place to stay! Elizabeth was wonderful and her animals too. The patio/garden was great and there is a pool/hot tub :)

We will be back!"
15272064,482019377,2019-07-05,4474874,Barb,"We can't imagine a better spot to land in Salem.  Elizabeth's house is elegant, historic and super comfortable.  Not only was our bedroom charming and the bed really comfortable - the gardens, pool and hot tub are icing on the cake.  Enjoy the home baked breakfast goodies, fruit, yogurt, tea and coffee in one of several outdoor garden spots.  My husband loved hitting the pool for a quick dip before breakfast.  Elizabeth was wonderful about offering up walking trail and restaurant suggestions and making sure we had whatever we needed while at the same time we felt as though we had complete privacy."
15272064,483807181,2019-07-07,43383706,Mary,This was a great AirBnB experience. I would stay here again when passing though the area!
15272064,484387809,2019-07-08,142883622,Cynthia,"Would definitely recommend staying at Elizabeth's place, wonderful amenities and lovely house.  We only stayed one night which was a shame because we wanted to go in that hot tub so bad :).....Great Host!!!"

15272064,492896407,2019-07-21,38373688,Monica,"This is my second stay at Elizabeth’s house. I come down to participate in the Salem Art Fair. Elizabeth does a fantastic job making sure your stay is great, from the fresh flowers and banana bread to replenishing water bottles (much appreciated for the hot show)! Everything is very clean and comfortable. The house is located in a perfect location, including being very close to grocery stores and a Starbucks! I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here for a third time."
15272064,494690845,2019-07-24,122203600,Carrie,"What a beautiful house, great value! The bed was comfortable and anything you could need was provided. Salem was a great little town that had a little bit of everything.  If you stay and are hungry but not sure for what... look up “The Yard”."
15272064,495931689,2019-07-26,134346622,Alicia,"Great location, beautiful home and landscaping!  Elizabeth is a wonderful host, making everything comfortable and welcome.  Especially loved her banana bread pastries!  I will definitely be returning to stay here when we return!"

Also if you are in animal lover you will love this Airbnb. Since the host has a variety of pet chickens, roosters, ducks  and cats roaming outside of the property."
15272064,498447424,2019-07-29,138601112,Hong,"Even though in our short visit we did not get a chance to meet her, but we can feel her personal care for her guests in all the details. Her place is like an attraction point, so tastefully decorated with a sense of history."

Our room was so comfortable and the historical location was gorgeous! (We wished we could have used the hot tub and pool!) Everything from coffee mugs to air conditioning to makeup remover was provided and the room felt very private for my friend and I. My only regret is that I didn't stay here longer! 10/10 recommend Elizabeth's home to anyone traveling to Salem, and I will definitely be booking her place again!"

There’s a huge backyard area set for relaxing and since the house is tucked in behind a huge driveway it feels like you’re no longer in the city.

15272064,563382315,2019-11-12,222393776,Wayne,"EXTREMELY well-maintained large home built in early 1900's.  But equipped similarly to houses built in last 10 years as it relates to amenities and bedroom/ bathroom.   Treats provided as well as freshly baked items in the morning.

15272064,590469345,2020-01-08,296794161,Kimberly,I stay here often for work. The other day I had the worst headache and forgot the ibuprofen. I asked Elizabeth and of course she had plenty at the ready for her guests.
15272064,590820813,2020-01-09,56245202,Melinda,"This is a beautiful place to stay, very much a home away from home.  Elizabeth is always available, even when she is away. There are many extra touches, I loved having a packet of microwave popcorn to snack on!"
15272064,594462864,2020-01-18,85720126,Glen,"Elizabeth's is an historic house. The rooms are nicely furnished and decorated. The bedroom and bath are a little small, but adequate. Any short comings of the facility are more than made up for by the excellent hospitality by Elizabeth. Also she provides food for an in room breakfast each morning, including home made bread, fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal! Hard boil eggs upon request!.Big advantage over other AirBnBs."
15272064,595182095,2020-01-19,7186380,Paula,Great place ! We love staying here !

15272064,613813383,2020-03-02,9975830,Mary,"The ad indicates that the home is large and spacious.  It does not indicate that the house and bedrooms are rented to others, and in fact, during our stay it seemed as if all bedrooms and guest quarters were full.  We would not have rented the room if we knew that we would be sharing space with others, outside of the host.  The ad should state the maximum renters that one would encounter should they decide to rent the space."
15272064,616119968,2020-03-08,252231934,Estrellita,"Elizabeth provides a comfortable and warm place to stay.  She provides so much from all the toiletries you could possibly need to a microwave oven, personal refrigerator, dishes, utensils, etc.  There is coffee and tea in your room and fresh baked quick bread, fruit, water and extra coffee, etc in the hallway.  The refrigerator is stocked with yogurts and water and there is oatmeal and popcorn provided as well.  The rooms are very clean.  I love the sitting area where there is a fireplace and a wine bar with comfortable seating.  I sat there for a while one evening sipping on Irish cream and just enjoying the relaxing atmosphere.  This is all so amazing for the price.  What a great value.  What a great place to stay."

15272064,623096013,2020-04-25,275412487,Gil,I would have a hard time finding another Airbnb with so much value. One of the best hosts ever! Liked it so much added another day.

The attention to detail was superb, and she made both myself and my paw child welcome.  The amenities, snacks, and beverages far surpassed a hotel environment.

There were fresh flowers everywhere.  Coffee machine, fridge, microwave too. It is very clean. Elizabeth provides fresh fruit and snacks. She even offered me a glass of wine from bar in the living room. The bed in my room was a little saggy but otherwise its an amazing value!!!  There are pets on the property so this would not be a good fit for those with allergies or dislike of pets. Thank you Elizabeth."
15272064,630606856,2020-06-19,326529408,Jeff,"Such a great space and the host is superb! They have really put effort into thinking of what a guest would like.

A warm greeting,  a tour around her lovely home. And also don't forget your swim clothes.  Take a dip in the pool or relax in the hot tub.  Our room,  room #1 was beautifully styled and super comphy to be in. Slept so good we thought we were home in the mountains of Washington State and not in the middle of Salem.

15815105,114910847,2016-11-20,9836142,Morning Star,"The location is centrally located to downtown, making it easy to get anywhere.  I was so surprised to find such a large lot in the city. It felt like being in the country. The home is an old craftsman that has retained all of it's charm.  Elizabeth  was there to greet me and make sure I was settled in.  The room was very spacious and the bed comfortable.  There is an outdoor swimming pool that I hope to use during summer months when I need to be in Salem.  I will return!

15815105,125422969,2017-01-05,9784246,J. Kathleen,"I have stayed at Elizabeth's multiple times while traveling for business. Both of the rooms she has available to rent are beautiful, unique and well-equipped. She has thought of all the details to provide for a very comfortable experience. This has worked great for me for business, but also would be perfect for a romantic get-away. The larger of the rooms she rents even includes a fireplace in the bedroom and a clawfoot tub in the bath. "
15815105,126538759,2017-01-12,9784246,J. Kathleen,Elizabeth's home is beautiful and unique. She is a friendly and interesting hostess. Truly a must-see destination. 
15815105,126664926,2017-01-13,30983052,Tiffany,"Best host ever! I did not get into town till around midnight for a spur of the moment business trip. She was very thorough, sent me txt pictures of where to find the key for such a late arrival, sent me all of the wifi information, left the lights on so that everything was easy to find, and the room was fantastic! I had my labradoodles with me and they were very comfortable, room and house was immaculate, all the little necessities you could imagine. Very well organized. A+++"

Elizabeth was SO accommodating of our last minute reservation and was very communicative about our check in even though we missed meeting up in person. The room was absolutely lovely and spacious, with a fireplace and a luxurious bed. She even went so far as to stock the mini fridge with breakfast options, and the bathroom was really well stocked as well! She really thought of everything! We definitely plan to stay here again next time we are in Salem. It was so close to everything but still felt secluded and safe. Highly recommended and a great deal!"

15815105,136959693,2017-03-12,43695173,Karen,"We enjoyed our stay here while visiting our daughter at Willamette U. We were concerned at first that it may be a little far from campus, but we found it very convenient -- only about a 7-minute drive from our daughter's dorm. In addition, I was pleased to see that we could walk to a few restaurants, a grocery, and even a medical clinic within just a couple of minutes, and Trader Joe's is only a mile down the road.

The room and bathroom were very spacious and comfortable, and the bed was wonderful. In the bathroom, Elizabeth had provided everything we needed as far as amenities, toiletries, and plenty of clean towels and washcloths. The hot water in the shower was a little tricky to adjust for the first few minutes, but it turned out to be fine. We enjoyed the huge closet with plenty of space to hang our clothes. In addition, the room felt very private, with trees right outside the windows. It was a very cozy space on the rainy days and nights, and on our last day, the sun came out and provided a beautiful view."
15815105,137165972,2017-03-13,56732077,Carolyn,"Nice home in a private setting. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud, loved it!! Room and bathroom were clean, breakfast options were nice. Spacious space, would stay again!"

15815105,140783354,2017-03-31,25061335,Sam,"Elizabeth's home is large and lovely. It's located in a quiet Salem neighborhood. The bed in our room can be best described as ""cloud-like,"" and is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Elizabeth's home is located in close proximity to downtown if you're looking to visit the Capitol, and she is a great communicator as well. "
15815105,141349209,2017-04-02,29581645,Lucinda And Jerry,Elizabeth has a tastefully decorated English Tudor manor filled with antiques. She is a wonderful hostess with the perfect balance of helpfulness and privacy. We enjoyed the trip a great deal and plan to return.

I enjoyed it so much that I'm going to be looking for an excuse to visit Salem again just so I can stay there again.  Can't remember ever sleeping so good.  The bed was luxurious."
15815105,143222718,2017-04-10,124767712,Abby,Loved the room! Elizabeth was super sweet! Didn't want to leave! We'd stay there again for sure 
15815105,144101901,2017-04-14,16420508,Joan,We loved this place so much we booked an extra night. We drove out to Silver Falls State Park and hike the falls which is something not to miss.
15815105,144420216,2017-04-15,16420508,Joan,Elizabeth AirB&B is amazing. She puts a lot of effort into making your room and stay extra special.
15815105,144900724,2017-04-16,23192981,Johann,"I've stayed in Airbnb's all over the world and Elizabeth's place has to be one of my all time favorites.  The manor is beautiful, the room fantastic (my room had a fireplace with a morning view of the mountain), a separate private bath with claw tub, and a kitchenette stocked with snacks and breakfast food that was just what I needed when I arrived.  Her place is like a beautiful zen garden nestled in the middle of the city (a very rare find). Elizabeth is very kind, very thoughtful and a great communicator.  She took time out of a very busy day to make sure I knew how to find her place.  When I arrived she and her family made me feel very much at home. "
15815105,145343439,2017-04-17,16238488,Michael,"Elizabeth's place is a wonderful stop for a great rest. And she pays great attention to detail, very welcoming, and make sure that you're well taken care of when you arrive. She's very friendly and has a great sense of humor. Her house is a classic for sure, from the 1920s, but kept up beautifully. There are many mature plants and trees around the grounds, and the atmosphere she has created is warm and festive. Highly recommended."
15815105,145748296,2017-04-19,18355117,Bence,"Elizabeth's home is gorgeous!  Our room was huge, with a fireplace and big, beautiful bathroom.  We didn't want to leave after just one night!  Elizabeth provides more than the average airbnb.  We had coffee, water, snacks, fruit, yogurt, and even an in-room fridge and microwave.  She also provided a log so that we could enjoy the fireplace.  An in-room TV was another added bonus.  We will be recommending this site to friends who are going to be in the area, and would stay again in a heartbeat.  We had a top-notch experience."

The room was huge and beautiful - king bed (so comfy), fireplace, big bathroom, great view of the gardens around the house - front, back and side too.  The whole house was really a special place and close to town, but completely quiet.  We'd stay again in a heartbeat if we come back to Salem."

15815105,157142258,2017-06-02,1919417,Steven,"In my decades of very frequent personal and business travel, domestically and internationally, with accommodations in everything from tiny backpacking tents to luxury resorts, Elizabeth's house stands out as one of the best values and most private and comfortable stays that I have experienced!

The house is a recently-restored historical property set back from the street and hidden from view from all directions by its lush grounds that ensure quiet and privacy. My room was enormous. The closet was large enough to serve as a bedroom. The entrance so large, it contained the breakfast and snack items (i.e., refrigerator, coffee maker, hot water heater, fruit, oatmeal, yoghurt, etc.)

I was traveling on business. A well-lit built-in desk facilitated work. Another table was available for meals. The bed was very comfortable. I think it had a memory foam mattress cover.

The grounds are being rescued from decades of neglect, but already attractive and interesting. They include a swimming pool, greenhouse, chickens, and a duck. There are several affectionate cats in the house. I found these animals amusing and delightful. Once the landscaping is completed, this property will be even better than I've described.

I feel it was a near miracle that a vacancy was available when I needed it. My only regret was that I had to leave."
15815105,157397321,2017-06-03,104856837,Rob,Very quaint and comfortable room in a very large house/estate.  Host Elizabeth was very helpful and informative. Perfect location. Bed was comfortable too.  Cloe the dog . . .nice little greeter.  Shower pressure was weak. We'd stay again!

GREAT location for a Willamette Valley drive or sipping tour, or a hike in Silver Falls State Park, both of which are close-by. Communication was excellent and responses prompt.  Room was large and very clean.  Bananas, apples, coffee maker in room.  Bed was extremely comfortable.
    The arrangements, stay, and departure were all very easy.   Great place!"

The home is beautiful and the room comes stocked with everything you need! It is spacious and would be great for a long term stay. The yard is a wonderful sight and all the animals give it the perfect ""home"" feeling. I look forward to returning!"

Guest. 
Il soggiorno da Elisabeth è stato molto piacevole e rilassante. La camera è veramente grande e 
ben arredata. Mio marito ed io abbiamo trascorso due giorni immersi nella natura e nella tranquillità. Molto disponibile la nostra host e molto simpatico il micio Newton che al mattino è venuto a darci il buongiorno . 
Luogo consigliatissimo  ...."

15815105,186873802,2017-08-25,823958,Jessica,"This is a great value and was a very, very nice room! We really appreciated the fruit, yogurt and coffee in the morning too. This room has a private bathroom with a clawfoot tub/shower combo. Lovely property and cute cats outside. This is a historic home so bring earplugs as there are other folks in the house as well. We were awakened and kept awake by a man intermittently shouting between 1 and 2am. This was rough given we were getting up early the next day. The host was very kind and allowed us a late check-out so we got to nap before leaving after our early morning adventure. Would recommend to other travelers."
15815105,189397009,2017-09-01,120799815,Deborah,"Great old home very close to Commercial St. The room had everything you could need including a mini refrigerator with fruit, yogurt, oatmeal packets, coffee and tea. Elisabeth was great host. This was our first airbnb experience and I much preferred it to the hotel we usually use. We'll be back next visit to Salem."

15815105,190269292,2017-09-03,5655321,Nadia,"Elizabeth's place was perfect! Easily one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. Her home is incredibly charming, and you could really sense the level of care and detail she put in to making the experience comfortable, from the quality of the bedding, to the mini kitchen stocked with water, snacks, and coffee/tea located in the bedroom hallway. The room did get a little stuffy being it was a top floor unit on a weekend of 100 degree weather when we stayed, but that was minor. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Salem!"

15815105,195306963,2017-09-18,49673142,Dave & Heather,"Worth every cent. This home is cozy and Elizabeth works very hard to make the home yours. It is a rather large home - but has a personal feel.  The property is on an acre in the city -  but is blessed with chickens, ducks, turtles, awesome sitting nooks and beautiful landscaping... Although the residence is near all modern amenities, it is so very quiet. No security issues at all. We felt safe, welcomed and treated like family. We travel to Salem often and will stay again."
15815105,196033497,2017-09-21,77582845,Richard,"Lovely 1920’s era home with very personable host (Elizabeth). Some genteel repair work being done while we were there.  Not a walking neighborhood but only a 10-minute drive to downtown. We had a nice, large room with refrigerator, microwave, TV, king-size bed with generous comforters and numerous pillows. Private bathroom with some remodeling being completed."
15815105,197765458,2017-09-26,50824412,Yoha,"Elizabeth's has been the BEST AirBnb experience ever!! The house is beautiful with lush garden all around, really pretty! And it's located in such a nice neighborhood. I spent a week here without a car and was able to walk to everything- nice restaurants, groceries, shopping. While at the same time, it's secluded well enough up a small hill, so plenty of privacy and no noise from roads.  The room itself is large, with beautiful view, large closet space, comfy bed, nice private bathroom, comes with a mini fridges, coffee maker, kettle, and so many more. Elizabeth is a wonderful human being, she takes such special care of her guests. She made me feel welcome form the get go, and even offered to pick me up from train station and helped me get acquainted with the place. I wont stay anywhere else when in Salem!"
15815105,198828152,2017-09-30,40104763,Ann,We loved Elizabeth's place. It was huge and so unique! We could have stayed in that big comfy bed all day. Can't wait to come back in two weeks and try out the hot tub.

A spectacular suite with kitchen and dining area; charming bathroom with enormous pedestal sink, claw foot tub and stained glass window; sunrise view over westward hills; fireplace with side chairs; very comfortable King bed.

The location is wonderful...right off a main street where there were restaurants, grocery store, etc, and Elizabeth had some great tips on local places. I was in room 4 and it was so spacious and had everything you'd ever need with large, comfy bed, small fridge, microwave, food, all amenities! The clawfoot tub was marvelous to soak in and the fireplace with a starter log was perfect!  There is even a pool and hot tub during the summer! Less expensive than any local hotel, and soooo much better!  I would highly recommend this!"
15815105,213046489,2017-11-19,83974694,Rachel,Another great stay.
15815105,214353421,2017-11-25,115010064,Mike,This was the latest of several times staying at Elizabeth’s place.  It’s a great location for us and we see upgrades she is making with each new stay.  A great value in Salem.
15815105,220296073,2017-12-21,536701,Signo,"Conveniently located and a delightful room. The added amenities such as toiletries, fruit, coffee, water, cereal, etc., were greatly appreciated. The holiday decorations were also delightful."
15815105,220761849,2017-12-23,22996821,Katie,"Thank you so much for the stay. It gave us a great break off the road, and let us recharge and prepare for our holiday trip. 

The bed was incredible. Wish we had more time there to make use of the fireplace & the bathtub. The closet was about as big as our first apartment, and had better views than it. Everything we've ever dared dream to have in a master suite.

And the local donut shop we found down the street was tasty. Ideal way to start back on the road.

Once again, thank you!"
15815105,220971359,2017-12-24,92860368,Somal,Great Stay and location. Elizabeth is great host too. Amenities were more than expected or desired in an AirBnb stay.
15815105,221807944,2017-12-27,15978243,Stormy And Conor,Gorgeous place. Great location. Great host.
15815105,225516052,2018-01-06,109184685,Deona,"Warm, beautiful room in a beautiful older home, lots of character, private space.  Great trees on the lot and home is convenient to downtown Salem."
15815105,226820747,2018-01-12,20204748,Susan,"This place is even better than the listing can convey. It is perfectly located: in a quiet and pretty residential neighborhood, but literally a block and a half from a street with lots of restaurants and things to do. It is perfectly located and beautiful inside and out. I would offer to buy this house, if I moved to Salem. 

Elizabeth is an excellent host. She wants to be helpful, though I rarely need any help. She gave me a good restaurant tip last visit. She also has everything you need and more at your fingertips. A little basket of items in case you forgot to pack something. Every detail is thought through. Everything about the stay is perfectly convenient. This is my preferred place to stay when I go to Salem."
15815105,229449548,2018-01-23,150616571,Christiana,"Kind, caring and any need fulfilled for our room.  We were a bit cold, coming from southern California.  She immediately gave us a space heater which saved us for the following nights before bed. "
15815105,230229143,2018-01-27,23188025,Heather,"The manor is lovely, and we'll stay again on our next visit to the Salem area. The room was elegant, and offered every amenity. The king bed was super cozy, and I slept like a baby. Elizabeth and her dog Chloe are a delight as hostesses."
15815105,233231575,2018-02-08,3709146,Joy,Staying at Vista Manor is like staying in an English country manor.  The location is wonderful (very easy access to downtown Salem) and the home is lovely.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay.
15815105,233482840,2018-02-09,20204748,Susan,"As always, a great place to stay when I am in Salem. Clean, pretty, quiet, full of nice touches with everything I might need, including breakfast foods and fruit."
15815105,235734278,2018-02-17,109184685,Deona,I stay with Elizabeth when traveling for work and it is always comfortable and cozy.  She is a great host!!
15815105,238971918,2018-02-27,33458462,Carolyn,"I hate to check “much better than expected” because I expected it to be wonderful and it was – Elizabeth goes above and beyond every time, and we always feel welcomed."
15815105,239443733,2018-03-01,869605,Danny,Very comfy ensuite room with nice amenities.  Quiet and quaint.   Nice place to stay and close to downtown.

15815105,263325116,2018-05-11,14864925,Arlene,"The home is in forest and ten minutes from downtown.  The home is centrally located for my business trip.

The large room is upstairs.  There are four bedrooms upstairs.   There maybe other guests during your stay.

Elizabeth provides breakfast items, fruit, oatmeal.  I liked that room had microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker.



The hot water ran out during my shower."
15815105,264760727,2018-05-14,3940843,Gemma,What a magical weekend! Our family rented rooms with Elizabeth to be together for our daughter's graduation from Willamette. Elizabeth worked so hard on our behalf - fresh flowers everywhere; chairs circled about in her glorious back patio so we could gather there with family and enjoy one another; generous fruit bowls and breakfast items in each room; and ample off-street parking. We all loved the elegant living room with antique furniture and wood fire to gather before in the evening. Staying at Vista Manor felt like visiting family and we are forever grateful to Elizabeth for hosting our family gathering.
15815105,265612470,2018-05-17,1531140,Jordan,Amazing place. Very tasteful.
15815105,266278301,2018-05-19,71749006,Agnes,"Very comfortable bed, bath tub was wonderful, old world classy feeling, Very relaxing quiet and comfortable."
15815105,267471275,2018-05-21,178509570,Shawn,Elizabeth goes the extra mile with everything you may need/forgot. She had fresh fruit and bottled water in the room. The home is old but very charming and her beds are soooooo comfy!!
15815105,269037721,2018-05-26,5113993,Matteo,"This was one of the best Airbnb we’ve ever been! The location is beautiful, surrounded by nature but literally 4 min walk from restaurants and shops. It’s also 10 min drive from a bunch of wineries! The room we stayed in was huge, the bed was very comfy and the private bathroom was big and clean as well. It was like a little apartment. Elizabeth is a fantastic host! She made us delicious empanadas and she gave us a lift to one of the winery and showed us around. Fantastic experience and highly recommended!!"
15815105,270314449,2018-05-28,191038546,Thomas,"Beautiful home, a gracious host, and amazing amenities to boot. Would book again with Elizabeth in a heartbeat. Can’t recommend enough!"
15815105,273936336,2018-06-07,109247172,Mike,"Wonderful BnB with nice breakfast and extra special touches.   Wish we weren’t so tired we missed the hot tub, added from last time we were here.  Lots of food choices nearby as well.   Elizabeth is very helpful with anything you might need-like freezer space !!  "
15815105,275324020,2018-06-10,21684387,Zachary,Completely tasteful and period-appropriate decoration for her house. The pictures belie the beauty within!
15815105,277549169,2018-06-16,183435375,Tom,Great accommodations and location. Highly recommended!
15815105,278323845,2018-06-17,113232417,Douglas,"Wonderful wonderful Airbnb.. huge spacious room with so many special thoughts. This place is a super host Airbnb but goes beyond it.  We did not meet the host but her son was there to greet us and did everything to welcome us.  Very nice young adult.   Elizabeth also had wine to welcome guests, we never saw that before and best thing ever to have a wine after a long drive. This Airbnb also has a hot tub and a pool and such a beautiful garden area to hang out. We were hoping to extend our stay but sadly it was already booked.
Elizabeth is extremely prompt to respond, within minutes.  Communication was excellent 

We definitely will return to this (Website hidden by Airbnb) of the best place we have been"
15815105,280204838,2018-06-22,29711222,Lorinda,Enjoyed our stay and appreciated all the extras.
15815105,280640350,2018-06-23,24837886,Bonnie,A terrific value!  Room 4 is spacious and dripping with country charm. The windows and cool Oregon breezes will feed your soul.  Host was out of town but communicated with us continuously as needed.  Comfy bed. Great rest!
15815105,281406088,2018-06-24,184034899,John,"Don’t even bother looking elsewhere, you won’t find a better place to stay."
15815105,284567505,2018-07-01,23291542,Lore,"I stayed at Elizabeth's place while I was in town for an event.  I never met the host, but I left early and returned mid-evening, so wasn't there much.  The room was comfortable and it was nice to have the ensuite bathroom.  The pool was not available for use and looked like it had been in disrepair for some time."
15815105,288820576,2018-07-10,102541082,Tom,This is a charming bit of old England in the middle of Salem OR. It's a great location and a good value.  We will be back.
15815105,292314503,2018-07-17,139328462,Matthew,"Elizabeth made sure that we had everything that we needed including setting up another room for us when we had extra family come into Salem.  Room #2 was made available with our reservation of #4 and though a bit smaller it had every amenity that we needed. Elizabeth was a very accommodating and gracious host and if ever we are in Salem again; my wife and I will very gladly book here again. If you need something that is not visible like an ironing board for example; ask Elizabeth and she will make sure to make it available if she can. For being only a block from a busy street, the house and yard were very quiet due to the abundance of trees. We always had shade and the hot tub was very nice late in the evening. What a great stay! Thanks Elizabeth for all you did for us and made possible!"
15815105,292734223,2018-07-18,94094323,Kevin,What a charming (Website hidden by Airbnb) much nicer than the photos.  Elizabeth is the perfect host and makes me want to stay there longer...Down to earth and comfortable are the words I use to describe this host and her home. 
15815105,295062602,2018-07-22,33230749,Angela (Engayla),"This was the most awesome stay on airbnb I have ever experienced. Elizabeth is such a thoughtful, positive, kind, and generous host! Our stay by far exceeded our expectations! 
Thank you for truly providing a home away from home!
We will be back for sure!"
15815105,295964741,2018-07-24,137408046,Anjanette,Vista Manor is a magical place. Elizabeth provides all of the extra touches. Any items you may have forgotten to pack are available. The bed was comfortable and waking up to the sunrise was magical. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance. If I ever need to stay in Salem again I will choose Vista Manor!
15815105,296380564,2018-07-25,109734669,Kristine,"What an AMAZING place!!! We have stayed at many Airbnb’s in our travels and this place was easily one of my FAVORITES! Sorry for the caps I just loved her place so much! So many thoughtful touches, gorgeous property, she was a wonderful host and stayed up when we arrived later than expected! She was a dream and we had the best stay and had such a hard time leaving! We will come back again to stay at Elizabeth’s place if we are ever in the area again! 

5 out of 5 stars! If I could give more I would! :)"
15815105,296893408,2018-07-26,96242201,Patricia,"A beautiful, spacious room with so many lovely touches! Elizabeth was a perfect hostess making sure our stay was the best possible. Would definitely stay here again!"

15815105,299372192,2018-07-30,133144576,Christina,"Hostess thought of everything and was very helpful, lovely house and room :)"
15815105,299789454,2018-07-31,2515648,Joan,Large beautiful house in a quiet neighborhood. Couldn't ask for a nicer place!
15815105,300672067,2018-08-02,6368811,Betsy,"A place not to be missed if you're in Salem OR. It's beautiful, secluded, welcoming, and has both a pool (for the heat) and hot tub (for the cold). The house is gorgeous, with many spaces to relax and have space to yourself both indoors & out. Wonderful owner and host, Elizabeth. You couldn't ask for more! Enjoy!"
15815105,303559042,2018-08-07,31862841,Manya,"This was our first air bnb experience and I’m afraid Elizabeth has spoiled us! Her thoughtfulness and kindness has surpassed every expectation. The room was spotless, bed SO comfortable, and room filled with so many amenities! She is so considerate and has anticipated any neeed a travellor might have. Room is spacious, with table and chairs. Bathroom is large and filled with extra towels as well as more items a traveler might need. Her home is large, comfy and accessible. My favorite area is her beautiful yard with lush vegetation and comfy lounging chairs. She kept the jacuzzi hot for us and the pool clean with fresh towels. She keeps ducks and chickens and made us a fresh egg breakfast a few times. She also baked fresh muffins on occasion and provided daily water and fresh fruit. I wish I could give 10 stars! She truly is a super Hostess and a wonderful lady. "
15815105,306581215,2018-08-12,82195916,Jason,"Look no further for an amazing place to stay in Salem!!! The BEAT hospitality we'veexperienced, comfy bed, great space, and perfectlocation in Salem. Found a new home for when we come to visit. Oh... and the shower was to DIE for ;-)
"
15815105,308113548,2018-08-15,121763162,Jorge,"Elizabeths places is a jewl! The place was one of the best 3 I ever stayed on Airbnb, and she was a great, thoughtful and helpful host. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend her or stay with her again.  Thank you Elizabeth!"
15815105,309801503,2018-08-18,71702702,Amzi,Elizabeth has A+++ communication and was very accommodating! Her place was wonderful with a great pool area. Thank you for helping make my trip easy and enjoyable.
15815105,312071440,2018-08-22,56634987,William,"Vista Manor is a wonderful airbnb: mansion sized on a couple of acres, beautifully landscaped with garden patio, a pool and hot tub, guest house, eclectic collection of vehicles, a beautiful Lacy Wyandotte chicken, ducks, a large and nicely marked Rex rabbit, a Siamese cat, a dog, huge rooms (ours had a fireplace, built-in desk and breakfast nook,) but what makes this property a standout is something intangible: a generosity of spirit. In the hall there are muffins and fruit, a dozen bottles of water, the top drawer of the cabinet held a large collection of toiletries, tissues, soaps and the basket in my bathroom held almost as many items including new tooth brushes, a family-sized toothpaste, floss, a sewing kit, eyeglass repair kit and on the shelf above the sink 2 sturdy water glasses. The bathroom also had a claw foot tub-shower with old-fashioned copper hardware! The windows have no motel/hotel curtains or drapes. To me, this suggests Elizabeth possesses a generosity of spirit and a trusting soul; qualities too often absent generally in our fast-paced and sometimes cynical society."
15815105,312582402,2018-08-23,95885947,Duy,"A true 5-star experience like you would find in an actual 5-star hotel.  Communication is detailed and host was easy to reach. She went a lot of extra miles to ensure I was able to find her place and that I am properly checked in. The welcome was very warm. 
The room is vastly spacious with an equally massive list of what she provides. I'm talking everything from snacks to microwave to sew kits. There is truly an impressive number of things Elizabeth provides you. 
In short, if you choose to book, you will get a room as big as a living room, hospitality as warm as home, and a list of ammenities that rivals a 5-star hotel. 
"
15815105,315427737,2018-08-28,120987280,Jenny,"Great suite with private bath, in room microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator and snacks.

The room is clean and spacious with plenty of room for the 2 of us and our dog. Loved the homemade treats, fruit bowl, and assorted breakfast fare  as well as having the mini-fridge, microwave, and Keurig in the room.  We loved strolling around the huge property and the neighborhood. The location is very convenient to downtown."
15815105,325820252,2018-09-20,214025719,Tamme,"Elizabeth's was quiet, comfortable and close to everything.  The king size bed was like sleeping in butter."
15815105,326199071,2018-09-21,59378167,Paul,"My wife and I have stayed at five Airbnb's in the Salem area and Elizabeth's place is by far the best.  Beginning with the lovely home and Elizabeth's warm and fun personality, then continuing with the large guest room with a very comfortable and spacious bed plus a walk-in closet with a view and the private bath, as well as the homemade pumpkin bread and nice extras (fresh fruit, snack bars, oatmeal, popcorn, etc.  The entire experience was wonderful.  And for smokers (I enjoy a nice cigar each evening), Elizabeth graciously allowed me use of the patio and garden area for this pleasure.  The cats were an added bonus, as well as the very calm golden retriever, Chloe.  We highly recommend this extra-special place for visitors to Salem!"
15815105,328602302,2018-09-26,152244303,Cherel,Always a great stay - our base for being with the grandkids - Elizabeth makes it so easy with her thoughtful touches.

Staying in the lovely room with the king bed is a real treat – there’s almost room to hold a dance inside and the bathroom is large enough for four people to be getting ready at the same time!  Pumpkin bread in the morning and I feel well taken care of!
15815105,334339032,2018-10-08,191561579,Sam,"Wonderful place to stay. Beautiful home with clean room and bathroom. Elizabeth is very helpful if you have questions. All the extras (muffins, bottled water, etc) were nice extras. Would definitely stay again."

15815105,334956927,2018-10-10,219734194,Stephanie,Wonderful stay- with great breakfast and super comfy bed!
15815105,340099407,2018-10-22,18835826,Annette,"Elizabeth's place was the first time I stayed inside an AirBnB residence, so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as privacy, etc.  Her place went beyond my expectations- it was an absolutely lovely and comfortable space, and she provided every amenity you could possibly need and more.  Everything from location, communication, parking, access to restaurants and shopping was top notch.  I hope to stay here again when I am in the area again."
15815105,342485855,2018-10-28,40104763,Ann,Elizabeth’s Place home away for home for us. Our daughters go to college in Salem so we book Elizabeth’s Place whenever it is available. The bed is so comfortable that I had the hardest time getting out of it to leave today!!
15815105,344485640,2018-11-03,47989343,Caroline,"Great house, very nicely and cohesively decorated as well as preserved. Great room! It was a large room with plenty of space for our things and was an incredibly comfy long bed!

The windows are nice, the bathtub is great, and the tea/coffee and breakfast options are good and convenient. Also, Elizabeth is quite pleasant and helpful and the various animals that can be sighted sometimes are cute :) Especially the huge gray and white bunny :)"
15815105,358256694,2018-12-13,31287476,Susan,"Elizabeth's home is the nicest place we have ever stayed in all our travels.  The home is very large and beautifully decorated. The bedroom we stayed in was spacious with a sitting area in front of the fireplace, beautiful woodwork and windows with a view out to the grounds.  (The property used to be a nursery, so there are many species of trees and plants in the landscape.)   The bed was so comfortable that we checked out what kind of mattress so we could get one for our home.  The large private bathroom had a claw-foot tub and shower, and there is a huge walk-in closet. There were fresh baked muffins and fruit every day.  Our host was just the right blend of professional and friendly.  We felt right at home from the beginning. There were so many special touches throughout our stay.  I will be staying there from now on when we visit Salem!"
15815105,362152529,2018-12-25,62833184,Sharon,We stayed in a comfortable suite with a very comfortable king bed. There were many thoughtful extras such as bottled water and homemade bread.
15815105,408227404,2019-02-03,232616732,Michelle,"I stayed here for several weeks when I first moved to Salem and it was a nice welcome to the area. Elizabeth is a great host who goes out of her way to make sure that guests are comfortable and have everything they might need on hand. Rooms for this Airbnb are in a beautiful old house located within walking distance to several restaurants and a grocery store. The room was very clean and was stocked with plenty of towels, as well as pretty much every amenity you may have forgotten or would need. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet, so sleeping peacefully was no problem. Because my stay was in the winter, I could not really enjoy the back garden, but it seemed like it would be a great place to lounge around and relax in when it was not so cold and rainy."
15815105,410844462,2019-02-10,3963056,Don,"If you are needing a beautiful and comfortable place to relax, this is it!  We stayed in the upstairs suite for 2 nights as we attended a professional conference in Dallas, OR, 20 min away.  Suite included large bathroom with claw foot bath and shower. The king bed was s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) comfortable.  2 armchairs, a small table and chairs, dresser, desk, fireplace, and large walk in closet.  There was fresh fruit, baked goods daily, yogurt, oatmeal,  teas and coffee available for a quick breakfast.  Wine downstairs.  And a very nice hot tub that was wonderful at night.  Beautiful grounds.  Surrounded by trees.  Walkable to restaurants.  Outstanding hospitality and care given by Elizabeth.  Would highly recommend.  P.S.  There is a smaller queen size bedroom with a private bath on the same floor, also available on her site.  FYI: You must be able to climb a flight of stairs."
15815105,411535747,2019-02-12,15090402,Gwen,Beautiful room with everything anyone could possibly need!
15815105,425729596,2019-03-18,138796271,Jeannette,"Fabulous home, hospitality, and service! We look forward to our next trip just to stay here! Elizabeth is amazing and very thoughtful!"
15815105,426322079,2019-03-20,248847949,Elizabeth,"Elizabeth is a phenomenal host, and the room was amazing! From a coffee maker, to a robe for the hot tub, to a sewing kit, no detail or potential need was overlooked. The location is great--groceries, restaurants, and cafes are all in walking distance. The property is gorgeous, and the outside kitties were very sweet and friendly. She was able to accommodate a later check-in for me, which I really appreciated."
15815105,428328937,2019-03-24,127183864,Jessica,"This home is beautiful! It is placed just off the beaten path where the traffic is quite but you are still just minutes from all the action. The roundabout drive way made parking simple and could easily accommodate a truck and trailer. Elizabeth graciously greeted us apon our arrival. The keypad entry was a great addition especially because I may have forgotten  my keys in the room once. Inside the house is very clean and well decorated. There is lots of space for guests to sit and enjoy the space. There is even an office on the first floor for you late night workers who wish to not disturb your partner. We stayed in the master bedroom which is just up the staircase. The stairs are wide making baggage hauling easy. As you reach the top of the  stairs there is a table filled with fruit and fresh baked goods around the clock. My Six Year Old Son definitely had more than his share and I may have as well. The master room is just to the right and it is huge! It has a dead bolt so you can secure your room. As you walk in you have your own fully stocked kitchenette, two chair seating by the fireplace which can be used. Loved that. A super soft king size bed, large tv and a table and chairs placed by two gorgeous window over looking the back yard. The bathroom like the rest of the room was well lit and very clean. Elizabeth really went the extra mile to try and provide everything you may have forgot in your travel. But for me the best part was the closet it was huge and my son was so excited about it that he made it his room complete with a mattress covered cot provided by the host. Over all we were very comfortable here so much so that my son tried refusing to leave. Elizabeth was an amazing host and has successfully in my option created a great BnB. Thank you for opening your home for us to enjoy. We will be back!"
15815105,429045018,2019-03-26,986656,Jackie,The room at Elizabeth’s house was delightful! We had everything we needed along with many thoughtful touches including homemade banana bread. The room overlooked the garden and had a view of the city lights. The bed was very comfortable. The room itself was large and roomy. We could also have made a fire in the fireplace if we wished. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with and was also very helpful. You’ll love staying at her place in Salem!
15815105,433526842,2019-04-06,46177673,Troy,"Great spot, great host, I would definitely recommend!"
15815105,445174686,2019-04-28,258214879,Shauna,"Elizabeth is an amazing host! She thinks of everything and my room was beautiful, clean, comfortable. My stay was luxurious and rejuvenating! I highly recommend this spot!"
15815105,446104461,2019-04-30,2116298,Kris,Such a fabulous house and such a nice lady! We loved it!
15815105,453374036,2019-05-15,57820866,Jeanne,"A beautiful, warm and welcoming home with a wonderful host. Full of thoughtful touches that made me SO comfortable, from quilts to small fridge, microwave, dishes, tasty treats... I almost hate to say how lovely it is, because I want to keep it as my little secret get away!"
15815105,456858604,2019-05-22,39158514,Walker,"Elizabeth is an outstanding host.  Communication was excellent, and how many places have fruit and fresh banana bread outside your room?  Her house is magnificent, and full of historic charm."
15815105,459790408,2019-05-27,141383937,Rj,Elizabeth’s home is sparkling clean with more than enough space to accommodate you and your party. She was very hospitable and made everything very easy. Will definitely book again!!
15815105,461036559,2019-05-30,62065,Janet,"This beautiful Tudor home is an oasis right next to city amenities.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a really nice grocery. The interior of the home has many original fixtures and the decor is fancilly tasteful, without being at all pretentious. Very comfortable!
The kingsize bed was like sleeping on a giant cloud. And I took a couple of nice long baths in the clawfoot tub. This room was my kind of lodgings. 
Elizabeth the host is so friendly and great to talk with. And her menagerie of cute critters were fun to watch and hang out with. (Look for a very handsome rabbit!)
When I find myself in Salem again, I do hope their might be a vacancy at this lovely estate. Fingers crossed!"
15815105,463179370,2019-06-02,59477049,Gregory,Both my wife and I enjoyed a very pleasant and relaxing stay at Elizabeth's home. Even though you are in the city of Salem you almost  feel like you are out in the country! We were quite surprised and happy to find that our roomy second floor bedroom & bath had many amenities and personal touches that we didn't expect! We found Elizabeth's hospitality to be  exquisitely delightful! (:
15815105,464893838,2019-06-06,57820866,Jeanne,"Beautiful old home with a lovely yard being restored to its former glory. Quiet, peaceful, welcoming... a true home away from home."
15815105,465430043,2019-06-07,129014658,Diane,Beautiful homey place to rest and unwind. Restaurants near by. Quiet and cozy . Highly recommend.
15815105,465920625,2019-06-08,44198116,Theron,"Great value for the money, beautiful space. Only ding on the experience was a probably uncommon party at the house that was loud and boxed our car in"
15815105,466987306,2019-06-09,192260374,Gwen,"This was a spacious accommodation in a unique, lovely home.  We hope it is available the next time we visit Salem.  The coffee, fruit and muffins were a treat."
15815105,468096709,2019-06-11,192376201,仁全,"房东热情善良,好客大方,服务周到,细致,体贴｡环境清静优雅,地理位置优越｡是我此次旅行中性价比最优的民俗旅店｡向我所有的亲友们大力推荐!"
15815105,468987761,2019-06-13,267486655,Sue,A nice home away from home.  Elizabeth and her son are most accommodating.  Thank  you.
15815105,470957372,2019-06-16,145883599,Del  & Judy,"Treat yourself to a stay in this beautiful, nostalgic suite.   The bed was comfy, amenities are amazing, and you'll get to understand what is so special about claw foot tubs!  
We are hosts ourselves who strive for perfection for guests.  Elizabeth is just as amazing as her room!    Her place would rival 5 star hotels.  Look no further and book this amazing Air Bnb!"
15815105,473472788,2019-06-21,88556308,Susan,Beautiful classic home with lovey gardens and very Elizabeth was a great host and our room was spectacular.  So loved the claw foot tub and working space in room.   Was extremely clean with fresh flowers and extra amenities.  We will always come back here every time we come to visit relatives in Salem!!!  LOVED IT!!
15815105,475129940,2019-06-23,173598285,Kim,Our visit went beyond our expectations and needs. The room was splendid and very comfortable with many unexpected touches. We will try and stay with Elizabeth again if we are back in Salem.
15815105,476663641,2019-06-26,185540004,John,"Above and beyond in a wonderful upstairs, king bed room with tons of space and storage.  A clubfoot tub to relax in or shower in luxury.  Extras galore, Keurig coffee pot with coffee pods, tea pods, tea bags, bathroom amenities are abundant in case you forgot anything.  Elizabeth is available and helpful.  Wonderful stay."
15815105,477165215,2019-06-27,1131636,Jeanne & Bruce,"If you're ever in Salem stay at Vista Manor. You won't be disappointed. Elizabeth is an exceptional host and her home is absolutely beautiful. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely stay there..."
15815105,477747394,2019-06-28,122764052,Anne Marie,A slice of heaven in a secret hamlet in south Salem!
15815105,481407773,2019-07-04,40062431,Kiersten,"Elizabeth is an amazing hostess and we never even got to meet in person; she routinely checked to make sure we did not need anything and the room offered all the travel amenities one could possibly need. The bed was amazing and the room charming. We could not recommend this airb&b more!! If we ever come back to Salem, we will check Elizabeth's lodging first."
15815105,483649690,2019-07-07,3013004,Jakey,"Great, spacious room with good light and a dreamy claw foot tub. Elizabeth is a friendly and warm host who has a marvelous property that was perfect for my needs. 10/10 would stay here again!"
15815105,484874458,2019-07-09,81339673,Gabriela,Super nice and convenient place to stay. It was quiet and calm and clean the self check in isn’t exactly self check in. She’ll meet with you first and give you a tour and then from there on out it’s as you please which is nice and convenient. Overall great stay.
15815105,485350886,2019-07-10,203040883,Tee,Elizabeth is a super host! She made sure we are comfortable during our stay!
15815105,487103699,2019-07-13,103250586,Shelley,"Such a lovely place so close to lots to do in Salem area. We chose Elizabeth's establishment based on the photos or her historic home and what amenities she offered. The photos and description did not disappoint!
A lovely tudor style home built in the 1920's on over an acre of  well landscaped  grounds. The interior is tastefully decorated: we chose the king suite and it was spacious, airy with all of the toiletries you would need or want in the ensuite bath with a gorgeous claw foot tub! In addition there was a beautiful wood burning fireplace in the bedroom.
Elizabeth had fresh flowers on the breakfast table waiting for us when we arrived. We even had a small kitchenette stocked with fresh muffins, fruit, cereal and yogurt. In addition, there was a keurig maker with assorted coffee and teas with cream and sugar.
China and silverware along with wine glasses and corkscrew were also provided.
She does have pets on premise to which I was a little nervous about as I am allergic. Not to worry! She keeps a spotless home and doesn't allow her furry kids in the guest rooms.
I didn't sneeze once!
She was delightful to chat and message with. I had questions about proximity to Waterfront Park where we were attending a concert to which she replied quickly with directions and also suggested a few tasty dinner and breakfast restaurants to enjoy during our stay. 
I forgot to mention she also has an inground pool and hot tub that we just didn't have time to enjoy, next time we will stay longer!
Elizabeth was a gracious host with a lovely home. It is very reasonably priced for such a wonderful place with so much to offer."
15815105,488274368,2019-07-14,270873134,Marilyn,"Easy location to find, close to restaurants and gas stations (but you don't feel like you're in a city!). Very lovely location."
15815105,489935185,2019-07-17,189822787,Tara,"Vista Manor is amazing. Elizabeth is so sweet. The room is amazing. This is my second time staying here and we were in the blue room with the king bed and claw bathtub. There were blueberry muffins handmade by Elizabeth! The amenities are amazing and far above and beyond any hotel. The puppy I got to pet was so sweet! The backyard is beautiful. Honestly, the house is so beautiful that my husband and I enjoyed an evening in just hanging out in our room and relaxing. I will attempt to book one of her rooms each time I stay in Salem."
15815105,492908613,2019-07-21,33230749,Angela (Engayla),"This is a gem airbnb! A beautiful old Manor that one would not expect behind beautiful trees and gardens not visible from the street. Elizabeth treats her guests like family members. The rooms are very clean, there are fresh flowers in the room, she offers a welcome beverage and coffee, tea, fruit and fresh baked muffins in the morning. The Manor is also the home of dogs, cats, rabbits, and chickens in the beautiful backyard. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
15815105,494110003,2019-07-23,17635156,Ann,"A spotlessly clean and beautifully (period appropriate) decorated experience in the Tutor house where you can read all about the history  on the wall in the hallway (nicely researched!). 
We arrived about ~ 1 hr later than expected, but she had fresh blueberry muffins, fresh fruit, and cold water there waiting for us. The king sized bed room was very spacious with a fireplace, fresh flowers on both the work desk area as well as the dining table across the room, and helpful pamphlets of attractions in the area. The space in the room was easily double the size I was expecting with a fireplace and huge walking area as well as a large bathroom and area when you first walk in  (where you find the fridge and tea/coffee and cereals). Downstairs was a gorgeous living and dining area and library/study that overlooked the backyard garden where little tables to sit out and chat were placed. My only regret is not getting there in time to check out the pool or hot tub!  I think this is the best B&B I've stayed in so far (and I've used B&B in Alaska, Scotland, USA, Australia, and Canada over the years, so quite a few places). Guaranteed if you stay here you will not regret your stay!"
15815105,495917832,2019-07-26,39088343,Aphrodite,"Elizabeth’s house is beautifully appointed and very clean. She is l wonderful host. I loved the grounds that had lovely flowers, baby ducks and chickens! The handpicked fresh  flowers that were placed our big beautiful room was a thoughtful gesture. I would stay with her again in a heartbeat."
15815105,496671584,2019-07-27,275631861,Dillon,"The room was reasonably priced, comfortable, and in a great location. Also loved the hot tub and pool."
15815105,497792728,2019-07-28,268244773,Melanie,Great place to stay and a great host to work with.
15815105,498380477,2019-07-29,73077758,Alicia,"Great room, wonderful host - perfect for what we were looking for. Thanks so much!"
15815105,505086986,2019-08-08,37839589,Renee,"Lovely home, the suite was perfect for the 2 of us and very convenient.  The hostess made us feel right at home.  We loved the landscaping & Vista views.  Absolutely would stay here again!"
15815105,507707047,2019-08-11,270271220,Robert,This was my introduction to Airbnb and thanks to Elizabeth and the great accomodations at Vista Manor I'm hooked. Very clean and great amenities.
15815105,508328937,2019-08-12,32787097,Landon,"Loved Elizabeth’s place! A character estate with characters (ie: chickens, ducks, dogs and cats - of course not in the Airbnb areas). Suite was very large and comfy.  Elizabeth probably provided as many extra things should you need them (ie: toothpaste, bandaids, sewing kit, etc) as any place we have been.  So thoughtful.  Bed was great and the little mini fridge, microwave and Keurig was great.  Would stay again."
15815105,508965166,2019-08-13,44266693,Ben,"Great communication, very comfortable, and lots of little perks.  Felt like home.  I wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
15815105,512958739,2019-08-18,4637247,Brittany,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days for an anniversary get away.  Elizabeth's home was easy to find and located near several restaurants and stores. Her home was clean and comfortable and we had all the amenities we needed. There was water and breakfast snacks available, including fresh blueberry muffins. We utilized the back patio as well to get outside and enjoythe fresh air. Elizabeth has several friendly cats and dogs that allowed us to pet them -- as an animal lover this was a definite plus for me!  We would certainly stay here again."
15815105,514152428,2019-08-20,38802402,Lily,"Wonderful stay! Big comfortable room and quite night. Delicious breakfast. Easy access to anywhere, good location. Definitely will come back. Thank you Elizabeth!"
15815105,517678075,2019-08-25,136636199,Lisa,Great hospitality in a quaint house. Relaxing.
15815105,521292079,2019-08-31,40104763,Ann,We have stayed at Elizabeth’s many times as both of our daughters at here for college. It feels like coming home every time we stay. She has always welcome us and our dogs. The beds are all super cozy. Can’t wait to be back in two weeks.
15815105,522210074,2019-09-01,136636199,Lisa,Elizabeth is a great host. Accommodations were perfect for us. Just a short walk from local restaurants and Starbucks! When in Salem again we plan to stay here again!
15815105,522968836,2019-09-02,109250084,Brittaney,A beautiful home in a lovely area with a very accommodating and friendly host. 11/10
15815105,527776091,2019-09-11,138823690,Dan & Terry,A perfect location for us when coming in to town for a show at the amazing Elsinore theater. What a neat property! Very nice and stylish decor. Thoughtful amenities. Great value for a one night stay.
15815105,530429440,2019-09-15,171187567,Libby,"Beautiful home, inviting room, every amenity one could want, and a warm and thoughtful host. Definitely recommend this place and will be going back myself. Thanks, Elizabeth."
15815105,531970176,2019-09-18,4123381,Linda,"This was a lovely room with lots of space.   The bathroom was large with plenty of towels.  Coffee, tea and snacks provided.  A very comfortable place to spend a night!"
15815105,534594838,2019-09-22,60664301,Kandi,"Love the home and in a nice neighborhood. Lots of places to lounge and relax. Beautiful antique decor for all to enjoy, very clean. Elizabeth was there to talk to and show me around, very nice lady and helpful. The bed and pillows, very comfortable. She didn't serve breakfast, but she had bread loafs and fruit in the hall and everything in your room you could want. There was a small frig with yogurt and water. She had oatmeal packs and snacks in a basket. Very nice and I plan to come back!"
15815105,541105125,2019-10-04,16753812,Peter,"Elizabeth`s place ands Elizabeth herself is the reason why I travel with AirBnB. Her 100 year old mansion is superbly maintained, modernized and all clean. I can hardly imagine staying in a nicer place in Salem at all. The room is cosy with a great large bed and a nice view to trees and garden from the bed when you weak up. The living room you are welcomed to use is amazing and huge with plenty of history in. If you ask Elizabeth she is willing to tell you the story of that house and about Mexico and Salem as well. She is a nice and intelligent person with a great sense of humor and it is nice talking to her. The tips where to go out for a little dinner fitted perfectly. All in walkable distance. If you're looking for a romantic place to feel home you all right in Elizabeth`s place. She sure is a super host!"
15815105,543898152,2019-10-08,183314653,Patrick,"Charming/Affordable and in a great location.  Elizabeth is a great host, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Salem area!"
15815105,545126590,2019-10-11,46787863,Rebecca,"Beautiful historic home, wonderfully appointed. Very comfortable room and bed.   Elizabeth makes sure you have what you need; she is a wonderful host.  I wish I could have had more time to visit with her."
15815105,546649888,2019-10-13,678491,Lisa,This is a great place. I loved staying there and really appreciated all the little touches. I really enjoyed Elizabeth's home.
15815105,553290640,2019-10-23,2143228,Cynthia,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  There are so many thoughtful touches.  I was amazed I could bring my well-behaved pooch and there wasn't an extra charge.  The room was clean, and well appointed.  It was awesome there was fresh fruit, snacks, and bottled water available.  Elizabeth is so responsive.  And it was great - I forgot my phone charger and she had one for me to borrow.  Will stay again!"
15815105,560425884,2019-11-06,296794161,Kimberly,"I have stayed in all three rooms. Each is cozy and comfortable. I stay at Vista Manor about twice per week for work. I look forward to coming here after a hard day of work. Second to my home. Thanks, Elizabeth!"
15815105,561102530,2019-11-08,2143228,Cynthia,"This is the place to go!  As a traveling professional, I work long hours.   I arrived tired and cranky.  I saw that there were thoughtful snacks laid out, and I helped myself to some popcorn, and chocolate cookies.  Watching a movie and relaxing in the most comfortable bed was great!  Waking up and having a hot shower with all the shampoo and everything I could need was so nice.  I do feel pampered.  I love how there is also always home made treats.  Although I didn't try them this time, I look forward to next time!  This place is great."
15815105,563991498,2019-11-14,2143228,Cynthia,"This place continues to be my home away from home.  Also feel so special when Elizabeth comes and says hello when we arrive.  She has the little touches of snacks, home-baked goods - bottled water, and oh-so-comfortable beds.   I like this place so much that my co-workers and employees are staying here when they come into Salem.    Love it here."
15815105,566279200,2019-11-18,2143228,Cynthia,Wonderful place to stay!
15815105,572445646,2019-12-02,5230863,Mary,"Wow. Elizabeth knows hospitality and great Airbnb service. The amenities are amazing. Fresh baked goodies, snacks, fresh fruit, bottled water, coffee, tea, bathroom amenities of every sort including aspirin. She offers wine in the main parlor. Very nice and friendly host in a wonderful estate. Hot tub (all season) and swimming pool with comfy bathrobes supplied. My room had a working fireplace. Special place!"
15815105,572999677,2019-12-04,2143228,Cynthia,"Elizabeth is always so warm and friendly.  She brought an extra comforter since the weather was cold.  Everything is decorated so nice and wintery!   I liked the cranberry bread she baked this time, and a little chocolate left in my room.    This place is a great place to stay."
15815105,573615750,2019-12-06,40532240,Jerry,Elizabeth's home was beautiful.  She was an excellent host.   She made me feel very welcomed and provided many unexpected extras that made my visit all the more better.  I recommend her without hesitation.

15815105,575605430,2019-12-10,2143228,Cynthia,The bed is so comfortable.   Everything is decorated so nice for the holidays.  It was quiet and warm.
15815105,575910207,2019-12-11,2143228,Cynthia,Always amazing and wonderful here!
15815105,576543045,2019-12-13,2143228,Cynthia,Appreciate the comfortable bed!   It's so nice a quiet.  Great place to get a good night's sleep.
15815105,577660319,2019-12-15,17961899,Dan,I was almost tempted to write a bad review so no one else discovers this gem.  It was everything and more that have come to expect from AirBnB.  Elizabeth's home is hands down the best we have stayed at and we have stayed at many both in this country and in Europe.
15815105,578730581,2019-12-18,296794161,Kimberly,Excellent place to stay in Salem. Privacy and quiet abound
15815105,579462502,2019-12-20,296794161,Kimberly,"G
Quiet, helpful host, and comfortable."
15815105,581342577,2019-12-24,2143228,Cynthia,"I enjoy staying here.    Elizabeth makes sure everyone feels welcome.  Also even though I’m a frequent guest, there are different treats and different colored bedspreads so it’s a touch of familiar and new at the same time."
15815105,583525562,2019-12-28,60102748,Catherine,We had a great stay here! Elizabeth was a very welcoming host and provided a charming place for us to stay.
15815105,587933949,2020-01-03,274543681,Evangelist,"If you want to stay where you feel most comfortable upon check in and meeting your Host, then this is the place. She hasn't thought about everything a traveler would need when away from home. I mean everything-- it is obvious she is well traveled and you can feel this immediately upon check in. I will always check her availability when staying in Salem --  an amazing Host"
15815105,590484462,2020-01-08,274543681,Evangelist,Home is a perfect place away from HOME.
15815105,590815203,2020-01-09,274543681,Evangelist,Second week here and it keep getting better
15815105,591199627,2020-01-10,309574326,Karen,"Elizabeth cares about each of her guests and personally  greeted me soon after my arrival. She thought of everything  someone might need. The offering of snacks, baked goods, fruit and coffee was fabulous. The most was very comfortable. Elizabeth provided a space heater which made the room cozy as the space was a little chilly. Very in tune with her guests! Would definitely stay again."
15815105,592295438,2020-01-12,60664301,Kandi,We both loved our stay and the room we had. The bed was soft and comfortable. The house is beautiful and clean and old at the same time. Elizabeth does a great job to make sure you have everything you could want and need. She has snacks in the room and muffins and fruit in the hall. This is the second time staying here and we will be back.
15815105,593755887,2020-01-16,101740,Pam,"Such a lovely home.  I enjoyed my stay tremendously, and am already planning to return."
15815105,594059795,2020-01-17,219983607,Rebecca,We had a lovely stay. Elizabeth's place is truly top notch.
15815105,595212390,2020-01-19,286333900,Laurie,The Manor is a must experience when in Salem. The house is amazing and so is Elizabeth.
15815105,596760813,2020-01-23,274543681,Evangelist,I am working in Salem for the next 6 months and this is the only place I want to stay.
15815105,597101952,2020-01-24,274543681,Evangelist,Perfect host
15815105,597471413,2020-01-25,40104763,Ann,Another wonderful stay at Elizabeth’s! The only problem is the bed is too comfortable and I never want to get up. We stay here every time we come to see our daughters at college in Salem. It’s our home away from home.
15815105,598264340,2020-01-26,37005740,Kyle,"House filled with character and charm, in a tranquil setting. Great find."

15815105,612517691,2020-02-29,302102361,Chance,"My daughter, 6-month-old grandson, and I stayed here and the hospitality that Elizabeth provided was outstanding. She truly has a wonderful home and opening it up to the community is very much appreciated."
15815105,614577252,2020-03-05,274543681,Evangelist,The details is in the home and HOST. Lovely touches
15815105,614962686,2020-03-06,274543681,Evangelist,The details is in the home and HOST. Lovely touches
15815105,617716353,2020-03-13,274543681,Evangelist,"Elizabeth has been an exceptional Host, especially during this time. She has taken additional measures to make sure her guest are safe and protected in her home. I appreciate her and the measures she is taking to makes sure me and my family are healthy."
15815105,618728650,2020-03-15,274543681,Evangelist,Elizabeth showed care for me and my family during our final week at her home. Her home was a home away from home and I would recommend her place for anyone who is looking to stay in Salem
15815105,620123414,2020-03-20,274543681,Evangelist,Elizabeth has made my time.away from home feel like I have found a new home... She is considerate and aware of what a customer will need. I will miss my home.away from home
15815105,621160598,2020-03-28,23676633,Em,"Very kind, responsive hostess. A lovely home, with relaxing grounds. We were on the road from Ohio when Oregon instituted the 'stay at home' protocol for the coronavirus outbreak. Elizabeth provided a very supportive information, and a warm welcome, while putting the social distancing actions into practice. We are very pleased to have stayed with Elizabeth for our first few days moving back to Oregon."
15815105,625776312,2020-05-23,333023930,Lucinda,The place was amazing and so was the hospitality. Elizabeth really went above and beyond all expectations.
15815105,626457043,2020-05-27,164378958,Natalia,"Beautiful home, beautiful room. 
Huge rabbit in the background! Very comfortable king bed, seriously comfortable. The room was clean and well-decorated, BnB-feel which was great for relaxing. Guests were asked in binder found in room to go through the dining room to get to outdoor hot tub. However, door leading to dining room was locked.
Suggestions: Willamette Valley Vineyards is amazing. Also, beautiful parks, more touristy Riverfront Park or likes hikes and more secluded beautiful scenery then definitely Minto-Brown Island park."
15815105,627114964,2020-05-31,76801790,Katrina,"Wonderful Place! Great value for such a spectacular, warm and quiet setting!"
15815105,629114311,2020-06-12,86833187,Sue,"Elizabeth is such a generous host, her place is filled with welcome amenities! Lovely space, quite but near downtown Salem. We will definitely stay here again, we almost add the second night but our itinerary in Oregon is so busy that we couldn’t. We really enjoyed our stay here."
15815105,631301167,2020-06-21,69697471,Melanie,"Elizabeth's Tudor is a wonderful place to stay in Salem. The home, grounds, and friendly felines are both as comfortable as home, yet with a feeling of being in a special place. We thoroughly enjoyed the spacious en suite, the comfortable living room, and the delightful hot tub. It was nice to soak after hiking at Silver Falls State Park. Having some school work to finish up on-line, I even spent time in the windowed office area. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with and left us a personalized anniversary gift along with fresh flowers. We had delicious meals from Straight From New York pizza and Ritters, per her suggestions. I definitely recommend and will visit again."
15815105,632307895,2020-06-26,101740,Pam,"Elizabeth has an extremely comfortable home, with lots of privacy and a thousand thoughtful touches."
15815105,632624627,2020-06-27,105586495,Crystal,"Elizabeth’s home is the cleanest, has everything you’ll ever want/need! A must stay"
15815105,633148898,2020-06-28,105586495,Crystal,"Elizabeth’s home is the most detailed, thought out, cleanest place you’ll ever stay at! My room was more than anything I ever imagined- not only was it super clean before we entered her home she had masks and hand sanitizer prepared! Everything is surrounded in green nature, she even has a few cats and a bunny (they’re so sweet) Wish I can rate a trillion stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ if you’re looking for a place with maximum comfort/privacy/ restaurants all around you ...stay at this home! You won’t regret it : ) the sweet bread she leaves out for you in the morning goes so well with the coffee she also provides! A true angel"
15815105,634370949,2020-07-03,7447116,Carmel,"The property is lovely, Elizabeth has thought of everything, and it is a totally stress-free experience staying at Vista Manor."
15815105,634604062,2020-07-04,162019974,Leila,"Elizabeth’s place is elegant and beautiful. The house is a 1924 Tudor style house. We were greeted at the front door by Elizabeth, the front entrance had pretty flowers, and Chloe the pretty and sweet dog. We were led upstairs on a lovey old finished staircase, to our room which was a suite. We had access to lovely baked goods and fruit, coffee, tea, and other snacks. The bedroom was large with a king sized bed, the mattress was soft, we had a very comfy sleep. Adjoining the room was a large bathroom and also a  very large sitting room/closet with an extra bed. The floors were finished hardwood, the bathroom had an old leaded glass window that swung open with what looked to be original hardware. Everything was charming. The room had an air conditioning unit which we didn’t need to use. The hot tub and pool were invigorating. We had let Elizabeth know that this was an anniversary road trip and she left a thoughtful card and wine for us. We definitely want to stay here again!"
15815105,637547875,2020-07-12,352380915,John,"Stay here, it is perfect."
15815105,637911881,2020-07-13,272145842,Irene,This is a charming home and a wonderful host. We will definitely come back again.
15815105,638487712,2020-07-15,23584033,Dan,"Cool historic house, comfortable accommodations, great host, has everything for an amazing stay in Salem!"
15815105,638795071,2020-07-16,311206552,Mireille,"If you want fabulous service in a beautiful setting but don’t know where to go, this house in Salem is THE place to go. First, the house is gorgeous and well renovated. The pool is clean and perfect for children and grown-ups alike. The backyard and the back patio Offer beauty and peace. And Elizabeth is setting the bar very high when it comes to hosting. Freshly home baked deliciousness of many kinds, fruits galore, various snacks and more water and hot beverages you can drink. The master room is a dream, with everything in it, down to details such as first aid and sewing kits. If you forgot something, Elizabeth will most likely have it for you. And the bed is soooo comfy, you will sleep like a baby. And I even got to make an omelette with the fresh eggs from the hens on property. Elizabeth is such a gracious, mindful and caring host. My best overall experience with Airbnb for sure!"
15815105,640200301,2020-07-19,13457660,Joshua,"My wife and daughter and I had a very restful stay at Elizabeth's place. We were on a road trip, and so the king sized bed was clutch, and very comfy. The master bedroom had a small bedroom attached that was perfect for our two year olds pack and play, so the adults could have a separate room with privacy after she went to bed. The pool and jacuzzi were clean, and very cool and hot, respectively. We enjoyed walking in the backyard, searching for kitties, bunnies and chickens. It was a perfect spot for two nights for the three of us."
15815105,641197375,2020-07-22,181863270,Emily,Such a beautiful house and the outside is just as amazing as the inside! Would recommend to anyone I know! Fast responses to messages and any amenities you could think of!
15815105,646765709,2020-08-04,82195916,Jason,"Will not stay anywhere else in Salem! Elizabeth is the BEST and we just love staying at her place. Treats in every room, homemade pastries in the morning and AC in the room ;-) As long as she is a host, we will stay in one of her rooms!"
15815105,648374102,2020-08-08,6795482,Kate,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Vista Manor. For comfort and kindness, it would be hard to beat. We are in our 70s and transitioning from a house just sold to the new house, which isn’t ready. We and our sweet old dog would have stayed another couple of days at Vista Manor but, in spite of the innkeeper spending literally hours on the phone with Airbnb personnel, the corporate people refused to remove a block on an empty room. We were thus denied the use of the room, and we were forced to move on, with great difficulty, before it was convenient. A great deal of stress and anguish resulted from Airbnb’s seeming lack of consideration and total disregard for the comfort and wellbeing of the customers, us, in fact. It was enough to turn us off Airbnb for good. Frustrating and in the end harmful to our family."
15815105,652351410,2020-08-16,171724097,Haley,"Elizabeth was the best, amazing stay with very thoughtful touches. Can’t wait to return in the future."
15815105,656434662,2020-08-25,188371147,Angela,"This was our third stay at Elizabeth's place.  Always comfortable, and delightful!  Very clean and easy to come and go.  You won't be disappointed!"
15815105,660330962,2020-09-04,154598224,Tina,Great place to stay. The owner is amazing!
15815105,660639675,2020-09-05,42872079,Jake,This was probably the most well thought out place I've stayed at. Elizabeth thought of everything you could possibly need and has it readily available. The room was perfect and the entire home was beautiful. Was nice to walk around the back yard and watch the chickens and rabbit.
15815105,661322781,2020-09-06,111990320,Amanda,"Elizabeth goes above and beyond to make her guests feel special! She had everything you can think of—snacks, water, coffee & breakfast! Very thoughtful and sweet lady. Her place was very spacious, unique and comfortable! Highly recommend."
15815105,662421998,2020-09-09,183314653,Patrick,"Great host, very quick to respond to questions.  This was our second time staying and we can't wait to plan our next trip here!"
15815105,664070745,2020-09-13,349416600,Mike,"Clean room, responsive service in a unique setting."
15815105,664692537,2020-09-15,199324451,Randa,"If you are traveling to Salem, OR, this is where you want to stay! Elizabeth is a gracious hostess; and her home and the grounds are clean, comfortable and beautiful. Quiet and serene - a place to relax."
15815105,666909008,2020-09-21,176038296,Gage,Place was fantastic.  I will definitely be looking to stay again when I come back to Salem
15815105,668828316,2020-09-27,211742989,Jerick,Very beautiful home where the hosts make you feel so important. The location is in a perfect spot!
15815105,670557672,2020-10-03,367363341,Lori,Incredible experience all around. Beautiful home and grounds. Elizabeth is so friendly and helpful.
15815105,673012604,2020-10-10,262288431,Alexa,"This place is beautiful and quaint with so much fun character! The room was spacious and the hosts were very inviting—literally the only thing that wasn’t top notch was the shower experience. The shower curtain is inside of a claw footed tub, so it is very small and the shower curtain closes in around your body."
15815105,700272294,2020-10-13,371048741,Joshua,Elizabeth is really though and added touches to the stay that we didn’t even think of but we really appreciated. She made me and my wife feel so loved and so welcomed. Very clean and taken care of place.
15815105,701246285,2020-10-17,185540004,John,Excellent airbnb.  Well done.
15815105,701893234,2020-10-18,101763263,Lori,"This is a lovely, quaint older home with great character and charm.  Many special touches. Close to vineyards and many restaurants. Awesome decorations for  Halloween on the property.  We didn't utilize the pool/hot tub (out of season) but looks like it would be so nice!  This place being old has the creaks and noises of older homes, that is to be expected, but not a deterrent for us. Very comfortable king bed, nice hot shower, yummy apple cookies!"
16001174,493898313,2019-07-23,3586633,Chris,The host canceled this reservation 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17111184,137490007,2017-03-15,2874013,Rosalyn,"Jean is a lovely host. Her home is beautiful, carefully and artistically appointed, clean and bright. It is obvious that Jean takes care to provide for the comfort and convenience of her guests. The location is ideal. Close to downtown, the University, the Capital. This was my second stay with Jean and certainly not my last. The property and the host are ""super."""
17111184,157865356,2017-06-04,62342778,Tom,"Jean was very responsive during the booking process and extraordinarily welcoming when I arrived. Besides the property being better than described, Jean was nice enough to have a batch of freshly baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies on the table for guests. They were amazing. I wasn't able to take advantage of the bicycles she offered, but there's always a next time."
17111184,162419251,2017-06-20,134971951,James,"This is the place to stay if you're bike riding through the area. Host has a bike stand and tools in a secure shed for storage. Also she has a wealth of local bike knowledge, and décor to match :) The outside garden is a paradise of shade to relax in. I appreciated the separate entry and in-room bathroom. Plus a parfait for breakfast!"
17111184,168597263,2017-07-09,15811772,Sam,"This turn of the century house is a great place to go back in time to fir and oak floors, old rocking chairs, oval rugs, really quaint. Great period furnishings with modern mixed in. Relaxing. We will visit again when in Salem."
17111184,172388873,2017-07-20,126649108,Tu Anh,"Nice, spacious and clean place. Highly recommend."
17111184,173740452,2017-07-23,138228086,Heidi,Very accomidating. Great experience!
17111184,210486635,2017-11-09,142294753,Alan,"This is a lovely old house in a great location with easy access to the things we wanted to do while in Salem. Jean is a great host that takes pride in her home and the care she shows her guests. A long time Salem resident, she is knowledgeable about the area and willing to help with information. If you are looking for a quiet restful place this is it. No TV, just conversation with your host or fellow guests."
17111184,237640390,2018-02-23,142294753,Alan,This was our second stay with Jean in her beautiful home. She is a gracious host and attended to our needs like we were family. A peaceful quiet retreat within walking distance of downtown. We would definitely stay again when next we are in Salem.
17111184,256449804,2018-04-22,59483325,Alex,She made me feel very welcome I was quite impressed with her house. She made the best breakfast
17111184,302592714,2018-08-05,174403590,Barbara,"Very clean and updated 1912 house in downtown Salem, within walking distance of eateries, parks and other points of interest. Jean's house has tall evergreens on three sides that lend privacy to bedroom windows. We left windows open all night. It was lovely. "
17111184,306506057,2018-08-12,128744096,Susan,"We stayed in the Cedar room.  It was clean, beautifully decorated and had it's own private bathroom.  There were beautiful sitting areas, a desk with stationary, a couch, a table and chairs, all with plenty of lighting.  Outside the room, there was a shared living area and a small kitchen with a refrigerator and dishes, coffeemaker, etc.  There is no air conditioning, but it was cool weather so we were comfortable with the windows open.  There is some road noise, light sleepers might want to choose a room toward the back of the house.  Jean was absolutely delightful as a host.  She was attentive, and wonderful company.  She fixes a continental breakfast included, or a full breakfast for a very reasonable price.  This was a true BnB experience.  We will definitely stay here again!  "
17111184,316707991,2018-08-31,125892566,Tricia & Amelia,"If you are coming to Salem, look no further - this is the best place in the city. I recently relocated from the DC area, and Century House became my home away from home - literally - for my first three weeks in Oregon. I cannot say enough good things about this place! Location, cleanliness, warm and inviting space, quick response time, fantastic host, Century House has it all - and to top it off Jean makes delicious home-cooked breakfasts every morning that can't be beat!

I had the good fortune to try out two rooms during my long stay, the Maple Room and the Cedar Room. Both were great, although there are a few differences between them. The Maple Room has air conditioning, while the Cedar Room does not, so that's something to keep in mind if you are coming during summer. The Maple Room has a bathroom right next door that is quite spacious. The Cedar Room has a smaller en-suite bathroom, with a sink in the bedroom. If you are someone who is sensitive to road noise, be advised that the house is on a busy street and there are dogs next door that like to bark a lot. It did not bother me, but if that is a concern for you I think the Maple Room was a little more insulated. The kitchenette is available to both rooms and is equipped with a coffee pot, small fridge, microwave, and two-burner hot plate sufficient for boiling water. There is a cute dining room adjoining the kitchenette and Jean always leaves homemade cookies there that are so tasty.

Not only is Jean an amazing host, during my stay she became a good friend. She went above and beyond, from allowing me to check-in very late, to upgrading me to the Maple Room when it was really hot outside, to driving me downtown when I didn't have transportation, to storing my luggage when I was traveling. She's also a very good Scrabble player! If you are a cyclist, you are in for a treat because Jean is passionate about the sport and knows all of the trails and places to go. I also really enjoyed the breakfasts, which were always something new each day, and it was fun to have the opportunity to meet the other guests and chat with them. Stay at Century House - you won't regret it!"
17111184,317895031,2018-09-02,42868638,Tiffany,"My husband and I stayed here with our 22 month old toddler and had a wonderful stay, I am truly grateful I found this home. Jean is a gracious host and made us feel so welcomed. She loves children and it shows in the extra touches she adds to the room. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to any family."
17111184,348900304,2018-11-15,124400237,Emily,Jean's hidden gem was delightful!  I find myself in Salem for work and chose Cedar Room just because of its proximity to my meeting location.  I ended up being spoiled for 3 days!  Breakfast was amazing - so much thoughtfulness and care.  I enjoyed getting to know and a fellow guest over coffee each day and check in - late at night!  Was a breeze.  I cant wait to return to the area to explore a bit more and will definitely stay at Century House when I do.  Can't recommend Jean's hospitality enough!
17111184,353596625,2018-11-28,9940702,Aaron,"Jean is a wonderful host and the home is very comfortable. 
Walking distance to downtown and a number of other sites."
17111184,435217028,2019-04-09,33346460,Doug,"Jean is a superb host of an immaculate, well-furnished, restored, historic, classic Willamette Valley farmhouse. Easy drive into downtown. Great breakfast!"
17111184,491106272,2019-07-19,271246694,Chris,Jean is wonderful host and was very welcoming during our stay at her home.  The room we stayed in had lots of character with all the modern facilities we needed.  The centre of  Salem is a short gentle stroll (30 minutes) from the property.  We will certainly stay again when we are back in the area.
17111184,501482519,2019-08-03,277739108,Peng,A nice place .Thank you very much.
17111184,546677505,2019-10-13,27612461,Lisa,Jean was a wonderful host and had all sorts of thoughtful touches throughout her place.  She was very quick with a response any time I had a question.  She served a great breakfast and even asked about my dietary restrictions from the beginning which was such an added bonus!  I will definitely stay there again.
17111184,561536921,2019-11-09,172403012,Carrie,Jean was a fantastic host - very accommodating as we got in late. She responds quickly to messages and has a lovely home that was immaculate.  We wouldn’t hesitate to stay again or recommend her place to others.
17111184,602399004,2020-02-06,9633578,Christina,The place is lovely and very clean. Jean is a gracious host and treated me to a great breakfast over interesting conversation! Hope to be back soon!
17111184,618120751,2020-03-14,129712170,Patricia,One of the best B&Bs I've stayed at. I absolutely recommend Centennial House. Jean was just the best. Many thanks.

17238244,142332652,2017-04-07,100592459,Ann,This is an adorable house on a quiet street. We didn't spend much time in the neighborhood as we were there to see Willamette University and they kept us busy.  House is very clean and comfortable and charmingly decorated.  
17238244,143646675,2017-04-12,8025882,Iris Maria,"The is in a great spot, not too far from the Capitol. It was clean, comfortable and well appointed. "

17238244,158241189,2017-06-05,2616733,Elizabeth,"What an adorable house! We came to salem for a family get together and this house was perfect for everything we needed! Two bedrooms and a bathroom was just right for the 3 of us, and a baby too! We loved having the kitchen to cook breakfast and dinners at home, and the charming living room and decor made us feel right at home. Linda was always just a text away, and was so sweet to stop by and check in and introduce herself to see if we were all doing okay! Loved the neighborhood, and we were perfectly located in the center of salem. We loved our evenings at home and even used the DVD player for a movie night in, and there was also plenty of tv Chanel's to choose from! The beds were extra comfy too! Thanks for a great stay! We will be back again on our next visit to salem! "

A lovely quiet neighborhood with mature trees and flowering shrubs.  There's so much to do around Salem -- see the Capitol building, visit Silver Falls State Park, eat at downtown restaurants, and taste wine at the wineries of the Willamette Valley."
17238244,164300402,2017-06-26,130083237,Joel,Linda's house is cute and cozy.  Very clean and neat. The updates in the bathroom are great. The new paint and yard work make this '20's house perk up. Linda put in a new ac unit to help during an unusual heat wave in Salem. Perfect place to rest for our family.

The space is open, clean, and nicely decorated.  Hesitant to review because I plan to stay here on my next visit to see my daughter.  Thanks Linda!"

17238244,266940306,2018-05-20,188555364,Biji,We loved our family vacation at Linda's place. The house is close to downtown and within walkable distance from Bush park. The close proximity to Children's museum and Riverfront park was a big plus as we had a toddler with us. The house was clean and well decorated with artwork. Linda was very prompt in communicating with us. We had a great time.
17238244,268707160,2018-05-25,6582046,Patrick,The cottage was an amazing place to make a stop on a week of travel. Close to the main drag of Salem. Great to make a dinner and relax on the deck.

17238244,270212670,2018-05-28,32294076,Colleen,"Linda's place is a charming, artistic retreat from the city.  While close to downtown, the tiny cottage is clean, quiet and peaceful; the ticking of the antique clock is the loudest sound in the place.  I loved the collection of art displayed in the cottage, and I will never forget the sound of my son experimenting with the baritone ukulele and the instruction book provided.  That really was a once-in-a-lifetime moment. She also provided real cream for my morning coffee, which is a service I will always, always appreciate.  Strongly recommend."
17238244,273620682,2018-06-06,174627613,Kelly,A very charming home in a charming neighborhood in a convenient location. Extremely clean and comfortable. I loved the rocking chair on the front porch and also enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the back deck. We were sad when it was time to leave!

17238244,278291314,2018-06-17,13347482,Maggie,"Linda's place was wonderful! My parents and I came up for a family friend's graduation and it was exactly what we needed. Her place was very cute and extremely clean with plenty of space and the necessary amenities. Linda was very responsive with anything I needed. The arrival was easy as can be even with our very late flight.  The tree lined street was extremely quiet and very pretty. We wished we could have enjoyed the area longer. Should we find ourselves in Salem again, we would definitely use Linda's place. "
17238244,280250609,2018-06-22,66222614,Joyce,"The house is charming, beautifully decorated and landscaped,  lovely neighborhood, very close to a large park for walking along the river (with or without a four-legged friend).   A perfect spot to relax and/or base for area exploration."

17238244,282202478,2018-06-26,152997751,Juels,More than an old cottage!  This cottage has been completely remodeled with modern amenities and electrical outlets.  It's spacious and clean with lots of natural light.  It would make a great place for a multi-day stay.  It's ;located close to downtown and was easy to find.  Linda was thoughtful and responsive. I'll be staying there again next time I'm in Salem...if it's available!
17238244,283400312,2018-06-29,11162497,Robby,"Very cozy, host is very accommodating."

Be aware owner lives on property in a separate cottage.  Also, there is a basement that owner uses; and we were a bit put off by the fact that there was no lock on the tenant side!  We could go into the basement, but also anyone could come into our space!  Overall, very well appointed home that has been nicely and tastefully updated.  "
17238244,290030343,2018-07-13,68914470,Jessica,Linda was very helpful and willing to work with our unexpected change for our stay. I would recommend Linda and this place to those who are interested in staying here.

17238244,291952374,2018-07-16,133302152,Christopher,"I planned a short trip and excitedly selected a day short which left me searching for an extra day that was out of my budget. I emailed Linda and she assisted in making sure I had a somewhere to stay. Linda took great care in thinking of every detail in her space to make all guests feel welcome. The units were very clean with lots of little details that made the unit feel like home. I can’t thank Linda enough for being so helpful and responsive to each and every concern. There are hosts that you never get a chance to meet, and sometimes you may prefer it that way, Linda is the exception. Awesome place — Awesome human!"
17238244,295592712,2018-07-23,21933153,Marilyn,"Linda's 1920 cottage is perfect!  Cute, clean, centrally located.  We, my sister, nephew and I, were there for a week and it was just what we needed.

It was capped off by a great visit to the restaurant “word of mouth”. Highly recommend the flying biscuit and the crème brûlée French toast

Cool, clean, and well appointed, this was the perfect home base. We enjoyed evening glasses of wine on the deck, cooking breakfasts and dinners in a real kitchen, and easy access to the rest of the city. Everything we needed!"
17238244,311661180,2018-08-21,45559444,Jeanie,"The tree lined street is the first indicator that you’ve taken a step back in time - a time when neighbors talked over the fence or visited on each other’s porches drinking coffee in the rocking chairs. This is what you will find when you stay at this bungalow. Accommodations are spotless, amenities are great and the house feels like a home. Close to restaurants, parks and the history of Salem. Will definitely stay again!!"
17238244,313082875,2018-08-24,3996911,Eli,Linda is awesome! Very accommodating and responsive. Saved me some time and money with local transportation recommendations.

17238244,319925258,2018-09-07,3178842,Stephen,"Good house, good location--all you need!
Despite my reading other reviews and looking at the photos, I was pleasantly surprised at how roomy the house was.
Linda was a great host--she came by after I arrived, just to make sure all was good (and it was).
All the amenities you'd need, and then some. (I was just passing through, so I only got to enjoy the place for about 13 hours overnight.  I wished I'd planned to stay longer!)
Because I find that internet varies wildly in Airbnb rentals, I want to add that the coverage was good and speeds were fine (11 mbps and up)."
17238244,321172770,2018-09-09,28312502,Kori,"We stayed one night in Linda’s lovely home while in town for a wedding. To be honest, I’d been hesitant about the space since it described some shared area, but had no issues. Check in via the keypad was flawless, the property was spotless, the quirky decorations felt fun in the well lit, open space, and it all felt very private. We had use of the adorable craftsman home to ourselves. Linda’s communication was clear and kind, and the whole experience was wonderful. I would absolutely stay here again!"

17238244,328988650,2018-09-27,184726435,Donna,"This home was perfect for my husband and I.  From the moment we pulled up to the home we felt at home!  Outward appearances were charming, neat as a pin, so perfect! We especially loved the tree lined street.  

Linda was wonderful with correspondences.  Very clear with entry and exit of home.  Very comfortable bed and loved the high windows for the gentle breeze in the evening.

Other family members have stayed here recently and they were just as charmed.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you Linda!"

17238244,334997156,2018-10-10,2797485,Cynthia,"This is a great place. To stay if you are cycling the Willamette Scenic Bikeway.  It is one block off the route and close to a few restaurants.  It is well kept, spacious and very clean."

Lots of extra blankets and towels and coffee in the kitchen. There was plenty of shops and places to walk to. The park is only a few blocks away from the house. We would definitely stay here again.

17238244,358233155,2018-12-13,112712039,Tona,This was a very cute small house on a  quiet street within walking distance from downtown Salem.  The space was very comfortable and perfect for the two of us but would be big enough for a family or two couples.   We were only there for a night so we didn't get to explore too much but we did get a great walk in at Minto-Brown Park which is nearby on the Willamette River.  The home was very clean and had everything we needed to feel at home - even a Christmas tree!
17238244,358541612,2018-12-14,60541094,Robin,"Lovely house in a quiet, yet central location. If you're ever attending anything downtown, this is a great option."

After a full day of walking it was so nice to come ""home"" to Linda's clean, comfortable place. I enjoyed a nice hot bath in the sparkling clean bathroom and a wonderful night's sleep on the super comfy bed. I appreciate the nice touches like plenty of towels and high quality linens on the bed. The coffee supplies for the morning were also greatly appreciated. The neighborhood was quiet and I actually skipped one of my scheduled morning activities so I could stay in the cozy bed a bit longer. I was not bothered by any traffic noise, including trains. I will definitely be back."

Spotless & roomy with all conveniences needed, comfy bedding, robes and all the necessary kitchen appliances – including a well-stocked Nespresso coffee maker.
The home owner is next door, but totally left to ourselves. She gave great advice on where to eat and visit.
Lovely quit neighborhood. Would plan on staying here when visiting in the future."

17238244,461540251,2019-05-31,6213918,Mark And Laurie,"You will not want to leave this little cottage, rain or shine!  When we pulled up and saw the apartment buildings nearby, we thought, ""uh oh"" noisy.  Not at all!  The area is quiet and pleasant.  Walk the neighborhood if you have a chance.  The gardens are beautiful and the  houses charming.  Sit on the porch in the rocking chairs and wave to neighbors or talk to the mailman walking by or just read a book.  Then there is the deck in the back with beautifully planted flower pots and lights at night.  Another charming reading space is in the kitchen nook with skylights.  You cannot go wrong with Linda's place. My husband walked to the convention center for a conference and Bush Park is walking distance."
17238244,463044538,2019-06-02,23251882,Michael,"A charming home in a beautiful neighborhood on a tree lined street with a gorgeous garden and outdoor  living space. We stayed here as a young family of four and the breakfast nook made for a wonderful place to start our day before the kids woke up. (The blackout shades in the bedrooms helped maximize the sleep in time for our two little boys) 
Everything from the complimentary coffee and creamer to the comfortable furnishings made this a home away from home. Linda went out if hey way to make sure we had everything we needed and more, even making extra unrequested accommodations for our infant. 
Be aware that the double beds in the rooms are best for slender or extremely cuddly couples. Fortunately we're at least one of those attributes 
We hope to come again soon and repeat our experience."
17238244,463659145,2019-06-03,25016286,John,"This is the perfect place for either an overnight stay while traveling through Salem, or a longer visit to the area.  Communication with Linda was super easy, she met us make checking in easy and pleasant.

Her aesthetic is vibrant and inviting, with playful art and great feng shui. She provides ample space to stretch out and relax, with an AMAZING kitchen that I literally had to tell everyone I know about. That fridge! The cute cups! Every little detail was incredibly well thought out with love and care. 

I came here with my coworker and her daughter to study for a big test the next morning, our car was parked in front of the home. Sadly while we were sleeping we had a small break in to our vehicle, first time ever happening to this Airbnb. Linda was quickly notified, she answered and came immediately to assist with professional integrity.  She made us feel evry welcome and secure albeit the circumstance, because she was so graceful and kind to us I would not hesitate to stay again. She truly is an amazing host, as I have worked as a hotel manager before- she has more poise than I ever would during our situation. Kudos, Linda. See you soon!

17238244,652463827,2020-08-16,627214,Andrew,"The pictures undersell Linda’s house. The main living area is spacious, the whole place is spotlessly clean, and the front porch is a great place to wind down after a long drive. The kitchen is nicely appointed, there are enough tools to do some real cooking if you are so inclined."
17238244,652860456,2020-08-17,36939529,Tyrone,"Best Pl., I’ve ever been in a long time really quiet neighborhood. The park is right down the street. No complaints whatsoever"
17238244,653574737,2020-08-19,7649709,Aaron,Such a special home in a wonderful neighborhood.  Linda is a fantastic host.  I highly recommend Linda's home for anyone planning to visit Salem.  We really enjoyed talking summer evening walks in this lovely neighborhood.  Thank you Linda.

17238244,659170646,2020-08-31,3138361,Christine,"Linda prepared a wonderful welcome in a spotlessly clean home. I was traveling with my mom and that was important. The beds were comfortable and provided a great night’s rest on our long drive. We could cook easily, eat outside on her deck and enjoyed walking in her neighborhood. I would definitely come again. Thank you for the warm hospitality."
17238244,659720549,2020-09-02,105879667,Andrea,"Linda’s place was the perfect place to stay for our small family during our vacation in the area. Much more was provided than other places we have stayed, which made things easy and comfortable. Couldn’t have asked for a better fit. The cleanliness was outstanding too! Thanks again!!!"

17238244,669418828,2020-09-29,12430171,Susan,Linda met us at the door which we really appreciated. The house is decorated beautifully and so comfortable. It is a charming neighborhood of older craftsman’s. Restaurants and groceries are a short drive. We loved going for walks in the beautiful river park.

17424096,147083672,2017-04-24,126789772,Jennifer,"The room was very cozy, clean & comfy. It was exactly what I needed and Erenly was a very wonderful host!"
17424096,152070647,2017-05-14,37183798,Molly,Erenly was very accommodating and made me feel at home. I only really needed a place to crash and Erenly stayed up to give me a tour of her place before I crashed in her comfy spare bedroom! I would recommend this place to anyone. 
17424096,161366949,2017-06-17,116474020,Iris,The room is spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. Erenly is an easy going and accommodating host!
17424096,172722730,2017-07-21,8971215,Lauren,"Erenly was a great host! The place was clean, comfortable and quiet. I would recommend for short or long term stay."
17424096,184469372,2017-08-19,141554806,Michael,"Very clean, very comfortable bed/pillows, very quiet at night, even with window open. Erenly made herself available if needed, explained where everything was and explained rules. I had a dog and she was exceptionally nice with him"
17424096,185376554,2017-08-21,117946248,Benita,Erenly could not have been a more gracious hostess.  The bedroom is lovely and comfortable. Her place located in a very quiet and charming part of Salem. We loved our stay. Thank you!

Private parking space. Erenly was a great host, respectful and clean. Night shifters— You can get some good sleep here!"
17424096,265076990,2018-05-15,173077886,Liz,Erenly is a very nice person and easy to talk to.  Before I arrived I asked if I could have an iron and hair dryer available and they were.  Not everyone will accommodate that.  The area that she lives in is very quiet and secluded but still close to everything I needed.  If need be I will stay with Erenly again.
17424096,411251973,2019-02-11,225127659,Morgan,"Erenly is an AMAZING host, and I’m so lucky to have found her. Her hospitality is priceless, and her cozy home is perfect if you’re planning on staying in Salem for a while :)"

17433830,151445130,2017-05-12,951583,Charles S,"Julia's place is quiet, convenient, and has a great kitchen."
17433830,152679431,2017-05-17,111424883,Matthew,"Pretty much a self service rooming house.  Interior looks nice, just not conducive to a good nights sleep because of all the noise from door locks snapping loudly each time a door opened or shut.  Sounds from other rooms come through loudly, so people having conversations with others during middle of night will be a disturbance.  Bed is comfortable.  Room is fairly decent sized, which is nice.  There are 4 bedrooms upstairs that share one bathroom.  The two large windows give plenty of natural light.  Safety concern brought to owners attention and not fixed during my stay was a disabled smoke detector in room."
17433830,153805952,2017-05-21,52961966,Haley,"Perfect room for staying in Salem for a few days. Comfortable, quiet, everything I could have wanted, plus Julia is great at communicating! "
17433830,164294903,2017-06-26,134175509,Elaine,There was no ac which I was not aware of when I booked. 
17433830,165069226,2017-06-30,13135157,Lucy,We had a great stay in Salem. We were there for just a night to catch some sleep. Other guest were courteous and quiet. We would for sure stay there again. Thank you very much!

17433830,171054383,2017-07-16,139071925,Dacia,"They have a lovely home, just keep in mind the doors are really heavy and will slam if you aren't careful. Some of the walls are thin so be in mind of that, the two residents that stay year round were helpful during my visit. I would definitely come back again "
17433830,175031737,2017-07-27,30021585,Angela,"The home and motivation room were just as described. Very clean and quiet, for the most part. The bathroom was clean and spacious. It can get interesting if all the rooms are filled. Host had most things marked, which really helped in the kitchen. I highly recommend this property. "
17433830,176827053,2017-07-31,112133492,Kathleen,"The location is at a quiet residential area, a bit hard to find at night due to limited street lights. The room is as described, the 3rd person doesn't have a bed but more like a pad. The hosts are very easy to reach and responsive! We really enjoyed the stay :)"
17433830,180954244,2017-08-11,131356338,Philip,"Cozy, quiet, and spacious! Had a marvelous time in Julia's home!"
17433830,184003552,2017-08-18,880937,Connie,"Our room and bathroom were large, in a lovely house.  We came by bicycle and our bikes were safe overnight in the large fenced in back yard.  Enjoyed our stay!"
17433830,185391199,2017-08-21,4008831,Evan,"Great stay. This was the very crowded eclipse weekend but Julia and her husband managed it with aplomb! They were very accomodating, providing an extra floor mattress it turned out we needed and good information about whete best to view the eclipse. Very nice!"
17433830,185862453,2017-08-22,142849988,Anders,"Nice room, comfortable bed, quiet neighboorhood. Great if you just need a place to crash."
17433830,189132831,2017-08-31,82721387,Rick,"This house is a gem in residential Salem. Julia has gone out of her way to upgrade just about everything in the house, from hardwood floors to granite counter tops, to marbled sinks to a Jacuzzi tub. The use of washer/dryer was also most helpful. You will likely be left alone, so if you are looking for a quiet retreat, then you could not do much better than staying here."
17433830,190274075,2017-09-03,14560377,Ashmin,"Julia was a lovely host, even accommodated an earlier arrival. Great spot, central to the city and not a far drive from the wineries. The room was beautiful and kitchen had all necessary equipment for making a nice meal."
17433830,203795879,2017-10-15,154162031,Cynthia,This room in Julia’s house more than exceeded my expectations. You can prepare your own meal and wash/dry your clothes. Very comfortable bed- great after a long day of hiking.Beautiful house.
17433830,241112761,2018-03-07,25620333,Phil,Very nice house in a great location. Julia cleared up confusion that came up about rooms and keys quickly for me so I could enjoy my stay.
17433830,248095851,2018-03-30,58282807,Kaleb,Great location
17433830,277591547,2018-06-16,76055444,Charlene,"Great place, quiet neighborhood!
The room doesn't have AC but it's pretty cool. Room is just as described, amenities are well identified by room. Great experience. Julia was great in communicating with me and guiding me through the process."
17433830,279472919,2018-06-20,25620333,Phil,"A great landing place for me when I am in Salem for work. Good location, nice house,  low key, helpful host."
17433830,282224381,2018-06-26,93911688,Rachel,"This is a lovely home. There were several other guests staying in the other rooms while we were there so there wasn’t much privacy except for in our room, but if you don’t mind being around other people then it’s a great fit. The neighborhood is a little bit rough but not terrible. It has a mix of nicer and also some more rundown homes. The beds were comfortable, the kitchen and laundry room was nice to be able to use, and overall it was a great space."
17433830,284640476,2018-07-01,187903742,Daniel,An amazing place to stay that is peaceful and comfortable.
17433830,295526377,2018-07-23,36732568,Pamela,"Quiet neighborhood, very clean spaces both shared and private.  Check-in/out was easy."
17433830,318874302,2018-09-04,15960743,Lindsay & Garland,Julia's place was perfect while in town for work. I would recommend to anyone open to having a share space!
17433830,323039973,2018-09-14,25620333,Phil,Julia is constantly improving the house. Among the new furniture items was a really nice new desk in the Motivation room this visit.
17433830,325113900,2018-09-18,25620333,Phil,Another great stay at Julia's
17433830,340085143,2018-10-22,25620333,Phil,I travel to work in Salem a lot and the Motivation Room is a reliably great landing place for me in town.
17433830,343478910,2018-10-31,25620333,Phil,Always a great space to stay while I'm in Salem
17433830,345344733,2018-11-04,203290708,Erick,Great affordable place that met all my needs. Julia was very responsive and would definitely return if I’m ever in the area again.

17433830,355991410,2018-12-06,25620333,Phil,"As a frequent traveler to Salem I really appreciate the self-check in process at this house. I often arrive in the later hours of the evening and its nice to know I can just show up, get to my room, and settle in without disturbing anyone or making them wait up for my arrival."
17433830,401737103,2019-01-15,228983883,Giridharan,Comfortable bed and the property is maintained well
17433830,403372675,2019-01-20,77817236,Margaret,"Julia’s place was great! It was clean and comfortable. The roommate was surprisingly noisy, and I could hear him yelling while he played video games, but otherwise everything was clean and the location was perfect!"
17433830,409782775,2019-02-08,25620333,Phil,Another great stay at Julia’s place.
17433830,411530348,2019-02-12,32576217,Madeline,"Beautiful house in a quiet neighborhood in Salem, close to some great restaurants as well.  Check in and check out were super easy.  The rooms and a lot of things were labeled which made it super easy to find things.  The room was super cozy with a desk and a space heater, there was heating throughout the whole house but it was very cold the weekend I visited so the space heater made it super warm and cozy.  The only thing I didn’t like as much was that the doors were kind of loud and locking and unlocking made a bit of noise, so I felt bad when I had to come in late one night.  But otherwise  a super cute house!"
17433830,424046642,2019-03-15,168651793,Jose,Julia’s place was pretty much spotless. It looked great. The bathroom was big which was good. The flexible check in time was also great because I needed something same day and I was running late due to car trouble.
17433830,427472792,2019-03-23,126531232,Sam,"I had a lovely stay at Julia's place! Clean, quiet, and relaxing atmosphere. Labels on rooms and in the kitchen made navigating the house quite easy. It took just over 30 minutes to get downtown on foot, which wasn't an issue for an avid walker like me, and I imagine that it would be quite easy to get anywhere in the Salem area from the home if you have a car. Julia was very accommodating when I wanted to drop off my luggage before check-in time. I would happily stay here again."
17433830,438476917,2019-04-16,251580424,Suresh,Fantastic thank lace to stay
17433830,459069104,2019-05-26,61736740,Bryndon,Definitely not as clean as expected.
17433830,470962485,2019-06-16,265653149,Luanne,There are 4 guest rooms and you share a large bathroom.  Each person can lock their room from the inside and also with a key from the hallway.
17433830,473493413,2019-06-21,1450490,Adam,Great neighborhood! Comfy room
17433830,477692728,2019-06-28,25620333,Phil,Always a great place to stay in Salem!
17433830,521303984,2019-08-31,54596778,Gray,This is a very clean and stylish property in a great central locality in Salem near many restaurants and other conveniences. The host was extremely prompt in communicating and answering any and all questions.
17433830,540535954,2019-10-03,54596778,Gray,"A very nice house, with clean and interesting rooms - great kitchen and upstairs bathroom and a very good location to central and all of the relatively small Salem, OR - the host Julia was extremely helpful and always responded promptly to questions."

17433830,644831490,2020-07-31,338618565,David,"Fantastic home and wonderful room. I had the pleasure of an extended stay at Julia’s home and it was prefect. Quiet and clean, large room with great common areas and kitchen. I enjoyed every minute and Nick and Julia were great hosts who took care of everything. I can’t thank them enough."
17736273,165404326,2017-07-01,125600604,Ila,Nice place in quiet neighborhood.   
17736273,179556287,2017-08-07,139158789,Richard,Just dont stay here unless you want to hear a comment about everything you do and wake up at 5am to a loud dying cat. Just sleep in your car. Your welcome
17736273,185388986,2017-08-21,66669902,Sudeshna,"Carol's house is very charming. We were there with our little girl  and Carol found out things to keep her entertained and busy. The room in which we stayed was very clean, well decorated, had a comfortable queen bed and a clean attached bathroom. The house is situated in a nice location too."
17736273,285096722,2018-07-02,71400521,Robert,Carol’s home worked out very well for me. I stayed in her house for three months while I worked a travel job at Salem hospital. It was a great location and a nice quiet neighborhood.
17736273,318901911,2018-09-04,210775829,Christine,"Private bathroom includes shampoo, soap, razor, q-tips, cuticle scissors, feminine napkins, deoderant, and the softest towels ever! If you forget toothpaste, I bet Carol would give you some!  Bed is comfortable, and there's plenty of light (lamps and overhead lights) to suit anyone's needs. There's a small desk and a dresser and a closet...everything you could possibly need for a short or long-term stay. If there's *anything you need, you can ask Carol, and she'll probably provide it (within reason). Carol will talk with you if you want, and she'll leave you alone if that's what you prefer - no ""weirdness"" or hard feelings. Someone else complained about the cat, but I found him to be quite the gentle friend who knows to stay out of ""the guest room"" unless you carry him in there with you.  Yes, a few times per day, he meows loudly for 2-3 meows (checking to see if anyone is home), and then he's done. He was one of my favorite things about staying there!  :)  There was an extra, unexpected guest who keeps odd hours, but Carol is adding that to her description so there are no suprises. :)"
17736273,436297349,2019-04-12,62115692,Isabella,"Carol's place was clean and quiet, not much in city life close by but nice short commute to downtown. Carol was very accommodating - I stayed for 3 weeks so would definitely recommend for anyone planning a longer trip."
17736273,447479293,2019-05-03,98065902,Tim,Carol is a great host - accommodating my very unusual check in time. I enjoyed my stay. The location is easily accessible to downtown and south Salem.
17736273,488136329,2019-07-14,94116296,Gail,We enjoyed Carol's warm hospitality and at the same time her willingness to be unobtrusive. Carol has good taste in furnishings and our room and bathroom were spotless. The house is situated where there was no traffic noise that we could detect.
17736273,629994966,2020-06-15,207658069,Heather,Nice quiet place
18756208,161364274,2017-06-17,3917257,Tessa,"Becky's apartment in Salem is spacious and very comfortable. It was clean, the kids loved their own room with a TV, and she made it easy to check in. It was perfect for our weekend get away to Salem!"
18979869,185510990,2017-08-21,1792758,Jennifer,Sandy and Ben are the most gracious and helpful hosts I have ever met! They opened up their home and treated us like family. The location is in a very safe and friendly neighborhood with shops/a mall nearby. Sandy and Ben gave us lots of recommendations for sightseeing on the coast and hiking in the woods. I would highly recommend their place!
19144944,175396224,2017-07-28,142134873,Christopher,If you get a chance to stay here you won't be disappointed. Diane and Tom are great hosts and I hope I can stay with them again in the future if I find myself in Salem.
19144944,176392101,2017-07-30,142051763,Tricia,"This lovely home has a quiet setting with a yummy berry garden, flower garden in front and fruit trees in the back, beautifully framed with white oak trees.   The sunsets and soft breeze experienced from the hillside patio out the front sliding glass doors (with a fire pit!) were just the ticket for perfect relaxation before sleep.  The accommodations include a spacious and beautifully furnished living area, a roomy bedroom with a very comfortable Queen bed, soft bath towels and linens, and a clean bath.  The location is just minutes away from town - so it is convenient, too.  This stay was our first experience with AirBnB, and we were delighted.  You couldn't ask for more considerate and respectful hosts than Diane and Tom, either!  We will be coming back."
19144944,178128038,2017-08-04,12383454,Jay,"Beautiful space with a rural feel yet so close to town. Tom and Diane were great hosts, and were available to share information about local restaurants and Salem overall."

Tom was very helpful and stacked the fire wood in the fire pit so it was all ready to go when we used it at night. We had picked this location because it's close to Silver Falls and we couldn't have made a better decision. A lovely stay all around!
19144944,185525175,2017-08-21,38258143,Jennifer,Diane and Tom are awesome hosts!  The cottage has a lovely view of the garden and we were treated to fresh berries that Tom lovingly grew and harvested.

19144944,189764773,2017-09-02,117986757,Nathaniel,We had a wonderful stay for the one night we were here. There were even fresh strawberries and raspberries picked from the garden already in fridge ready for us to eat. I would certainly recommend this place to others.
19144944,190711015,2017-09-04,1799193,Kerri And Kai,"Diane and Tom were great host. We had a last minute booking to escape the smoke in bend and they were very accommodating.

Great communication and easy to check in and out.  Highly recommend staying at Diane's if you want a relaxing night!"
19144944,192654077,2017-09-10,34009991,Maia,"This is a relaxing, spacious and very quiet AirBnb. We were fortunate enough to enjoy some fresh strawberries and raspberries from the host's garden, and there was a fire pit ready to use just outside our accommodations. This AirBnb is next to a corrections facility, but it made no difference to us. You can't see it and otherwise the surrounding area is just rolling hills, trees and quiet neighborhoods. I would highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone in the area."
19144944,192977943,2017-09-11,30735502,Tim,"Tom and Diane made is feel right at home! We had our own driveway and private patio and entrance, plus a great view of the beautiful garden.

19144944,199319910,2017-10-01,19476072,Andy,"Diane was extremely friendly! The room has everything needed, including bath towels and toiletries. A few breakfast options were provided as well, which were amazing. The place itself is immaculate and has a beautiful back porch area with optional fireplace, which we would have used had it not been cold out. While we were there just one night, I would be very happy staying here for a longer time.

The house itself is just a few minutes away from a large selection of restaurants and any shopping needs (Safeway, Rite Aid, etc)."
19144944,200525622,2017-10-05,18891983,Janaea  (Janey),"The view of the oak forest and wildlife out back, the valley and sunsets toward the front gives this private retreat an extra charm for AirBnB travelers.  Located with easy and quick access to downtown or the foothills. 

The expanse of the interior space allows for multiple activities (e.g. exercise; family board games and TV watching) Amenities are plentiful and thoughtful."
19144944,202085016,2017-10-09,114762613,Charlotte,Everything was just perfect.  It was quite and the views were awsome and your hospitality was so nice. You made us feel very comfortable.

19144944,209718866,2017-11-05,3744075,Karen,"Diane and Tom's place is great.  Large private space with a pretty view of their garden.  They are  less than 6 miles from the downtown Salem and it is an easy drive to town.   The bed was comfortable, the water hot and it was very quiet.  We liked being close to town but out in the country.  It was really nice to have a small kitchen area that had food for breakfast (yogurt, milk, just, cereal and scones).   If you wanted more, WinCo is not far away."

19144944,240441563,2018-03-04,3318311,Geoff,"This is why Airbnb was invented. The place is clearly more than a business - it is also a lovely way of rural life that the owners want to share. And the apartment is quite a bit larger than we expected, and has a better view."
19144944,241862732,2018-03-10,23255936,Gary,"Diane's place was a delight. Roomy, very clean, and well-appointed.

Communication was easy, and her suggestion for dinner just right for us.
We felt very cared for and refreshed for continuing our journey home. It would be great to be there to enjoy Tom's berries!
Thank you, Diane."

Diane's home was sparkling clean and she thought of everything a guest might need for their trip. I enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and taking in the beautiful surrounding. I will be choosing to stay at Diane's if I find myself needing to comeback to Salem Oregon."
19144944,264788698,2018-05-14,15319777,Elizabeth,"Diane and Tom are such a lovely couple! We had a wonderful time staying at their immaculate and peaceful place. I only wish we had time to sit by the fire and spend more time together. We were there for a Willamette University graduation, did a little wine tasting in Carlton and it was a quick drive to downtown restaurants and shopping. The ambience of their space was both very relaxing and we felt right at home. We especially liked their radio, we didn't even turn the TV on once! The welcome when we arrived, the extra touches like cheese plate, La Croix water, breakfast goodies, daily ice water, and having a fan available were all very appreciated. Their place is top of my list next time we are in Salem. ❤️"
19144944,268720375,2018-05-25,15481379,Sandra,"Spacious accommodations, gracious hosts! Nothing walkable if that's important to you. But if you're looking for a quiet respite, removed from the city, this is the place!"
19144944,270303879,2018-05-28,64811055,Elizabeth,"Diane and Tom were great hosts. They provided a warm welcome when we arrived, gave us the ""lay of the land,"" and then let us enjoy our time in Oregon.  We really appreciated the fresh, cold water (I like to have water on hand at all times), milk, juice, breakfast items and the snacks that they provided.  They had everything we needed and more. Their land is lovely, and we really enjoyed our stay. The only thing that surprised us was how close their home was to a correctional facility. It wasn't a big deal, just a little unexpected. We would stay there again."
19144944,273342638,2018-06-05,96175986,Dean,Diane and Tom were very warm and welcoming upon arrival. There were snacks and coffee provided and small touches that made you feel at home. The space was very clean and carpets were exquisitely spotless! We enjoyed our stay very much.

This has been the most peaceful place I have ever stayed.  I loved listening to the birds chirping in the morning and being able to enjoy nature while sitting outside.  It was the perfect place for a weekend getaway.

19144944,284525580,2018-07-01,197184858,Carol,"It was beyond any bnb I have stayed at. Why would anyone stay in a hotel when you can have everything and more staying someplace  like this. For those that have never stayed in a bnb because they think they will be intruding,  They need to stay here.. Complete privacy, incredible hospitality and accommodations that far exceeded my high expectations.  I will be back and I will  tell anyone that will listen what an amazing place this is. Thank you Diane. "

The bed and pillows were comfortable, bedroom and bathroom linens smelled fresh and the kitchenette was stocked and the breakfast fixings she provided made the mornings nice and relaxed with being able to grab a bite to eat before we headed out. If we are in Salem again we will definitely be checking to see if she has vacancy!"

19144944,319929886,2018-09-07,77608552,Kathy,"You will be cheerfully greeted by Diane when you arrive at this Air B&B. Her and her husband were very thoughtful and amazing hosts and guests should feel comfortable striking up conversation with them and sharing their company. 

Diane is extremely detail oriented and leaves no personal touch unattended when preparing this one-bedroom, one-bath, personal entry space. I booked this place based on 1) location to my work training class and 2) price - which were both great. I traveled with my 6-month old and my mom (aka babysitter!) and stayed at Diane’s place for a week, so a comfortable, safe place that was more like “home” than a hotel room was what I wanted and completely got! 

Very thoughtful details included: a nice tower fan in the bedroom, night lights all over, extra towels that felt thick and luxurious, bathroom essentials (shampoo, conditioner, soap, hairdryer, etc), wonderful snacks, WiFi, cable TV, more than ample space, private entry...the list goes on. 

You can’t go wrong with this place and you’ll enjoy a wonderful and comfortable private space."

I can’t say enough good things about Diane as a thoughtful person, and how she went above & beyond, to make sure we felt comfortable & by letting us know she was available if we needed anything more. The apartment is very spacious & light with all details attended to for the comfort of her visitors. The main bed was comfy, as was the extra air mattress she set up with added padding, and plenty of room to accommodate an additional separate sleeping space. All other amenities were wonderful & inviting to us as guests, who look forward to seeing Diane again on a return trip to her home, when we have more time to explore the area together in the future."

We will definitely be back!!"

It is. :) Once you enter you immediately feel at home. The couch and bed are to die for comfy. The carpeting is especially wonderful to walk on in your socks. So soft and plushy.  Sadly, when we arrived the garden wasn't in full bloom or we would have had quite a lovely time exploring their huge garden and lovely yard. Highly recommended!"

We enjoyed having a glass of wine out in the patio stargazing.   This listing should be on the top of your list.  It provides easy access to Silver Falls State and that was a bonus..  I just wish we could have stayed an extra day..."

The space is also larger than any Airbnb we've been in. They have a great garden too. We felt well-provider for: among plenty of other things, we were given in-season fruit, a delicious scone, and high-quality well water. The place is located at the edge of town in a beautiful, extremely quiet country environment. The final morning, we were pleasantly surprised to find that a protective kitty was lounging on our doormat at the glass door. It disappeared before we could greet it."

19144944,539192730,2019-09-30,166911574,Susie,"Tom and Diane were both wonderful!  

The house is conveniently located close to the city, but the tranquility and peacefulness is countryside living at its best. There is also a nice view of some city lights in the evening and if the weathers just right a beautiful sunset too!

Their home was the perfect retreat and respite I needed while spending time with my father during his recovery at Salem hospital. 

Tom sent me some supportive text messages to help keep my spirits up, and Diane kept the little refrigerator well stocked and I was able to enjoy a little breakfast each morning.  I really did feel spoiled and didn’t even have to do the dishes!  

I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.  Tom also gave me a departing gift of some rhubarb from his garden.  

Thank you both for everything! 
Susie"

We were exhausted and Diane made it super easy for us to get in. We arrived pretty late and were able to self check-in and settle in for the night. Diane also had a mini continental breakfast set up for us, which was such a nice touch since we were getting back on the road for another long drive the next morning! The location is great not to far from Portland if you want to head to the outlets or downtown. The space itself was huge and nice, and we slept soundly.

We made a suggestion about lighting the driveway entrance better. The next night they had placed reflectors with address at the driveway entrance and down the driveway. Comfortable place and exactly what we expected.

I love the private bathroom, separate entrance and the thoughtful amenities -- coffee pot, microwave, mini fridge and use of washer & dryer.  Oh, did I mentioned that there is also a sauna that can be used???  Lovely backyard with shared grill.  Convenient to so many things -- located near Commercial Street in southern portion of Salem.  Host is friendly, helpful, polite and extra thoughtful."

The place itself is wonderfully decorated and inviting.  We were able to relax in the evening in the ""living room"" area, then settle into a pleasant sleep after. If you visit Salem, I would highly recommend a stay with Cindy!"

Cindy's place was a very welcome respite from moving and staying with family. We loved the central location for getting around town. The room beautifully decorated, the bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. Cindy really goes the extra step to make the space very relaxing and to make sure her guests are well taken care of. Thanks so much!"

19388806,185460731,2017-08-21,115742843,Cameran,"Fast communication, and a very cute complete suite in Salem, Oregon. There is the added benefit of a sauna, which we had a chance to enjoy.  This experience is the prime example of why we love Airbnb.  We like to have something different then the cookie cutter hotel room.  How great to have had a chance to sauna in our room."

She was very friendly when we met her. The home was amazing. It has everything anyone could want and need, even a sauna! Cozy fireplace and comfy bed, comfortable couch for watching TV.

19388806,194071370,2017-09-15,87400886,Susana,"Stayed at Cindy's with my husband for a couple nights and really enjoyed how clean and comfortable it was. From the  decor, to the soft towels, to the breakfast items. There were umbrellas next to the door and a box of tissues in the bathroom. Cindy's thoughtfulness and attention to detail really shows! 
The studio-like room is located in a quiet neighborhood, yet only a couple blocks from a main road, Commercial Street. We had a car rental, but ended up exploring on foot for a whole day. It takes less than 30 minutes to walk downtown."

19388806,205275476,2017-10-21,154828812,Patrick,"Arriving late, finding lamps lit, I felt welcome. So well thought out, Cindy covered every base. Fresh blueberries. Yum. Sauna before bed was fabulous extra. Cindy's 'nook' is private 'studio apt' like. Private secure entrance. Living room, w/ sofa, coffee table, oh, and fireplace by remote control. After rainy days in Salem, a welcome comfort. Secure parking in the backyard. Nice yard too. Stayed four nights. There is a washer/dryer right there too. So for longer stays, this is the nook. Why would I stay anywhere else?  Highly recommend ."

19388806,241872547,2018-03-10,126322036,Michael,"This suite is located in a quiet neighborhood just a few blocks from excellent shopping and dining resources.  It's a place to sit down on the couch with your feet up, fire up the gas logs, and read, watch cable TV, or listen to music.

The furnishings are very attractive and tastefully arranged.  The bed was comfortable and the noise level was very low.  The kitchen area included a mini frig, microwave, and coffee maker.  A washer and dryer were available, and the spray from the bathroom shower was hot and quite strong - it felt wonderful.  There's also a sauna, which we didn't try.

Everything at Cindy's was sparkling clean and worked as advertised.  Her description of the suite was one hundred percent accurate.  It was comfortable, quiet, and looked great.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat."

She's thought of all the amenities, with a luggage rack, snack center and a small breakfast.  The sauna is an indulgent touch, and really fun to use!  For us, the only downside was the bed; it was nice and firm but for some reason didn't agree with our backs.  But otherwise, it was a perfect stay!"

19388806,310650184,2018-08-19,21007267,Steven,"I wish we had more time to spend in Salem, this was such a cozy place in a quiet and convenient location. But we just needed a place to spend the night after a day at a wedding and reception. We checked in late and left early to head back over the mountains so we never had a chance to meet our host.
It was very neat and tidy it was nice to have off street parking.
If we ever have reason to come back to Salem for a couple of days Cindy's place would be at the top of our list of places to stay. "

Cindy was gracious, just popped in for a braief chat and left us to our lounging! Her place is well appointed, plenty of room for me and my grown daughter to enjoy our time together. Loved the nearby natural foods store, Life Source I think it's called; Cafe Yum (Yum!) and the French Press for coffee, baked goods and breakfast. And there was a homemade chocolate zucchini muffin for each of us in the fridge! Nice touches all around. My daughter used the sauna - said it got really toasty, she didn't last long, but a nice treat. "

Almost every guest need has been  anticipated and provided.  The layout, furnishing and ambiance of the Nook has been carefully thought through and executed for maximum ease and comfort."
19388806,328255355,2018-09-25,216740508,Michael,"What a super place to stay.  Perfectly located for walking to health food market LIFE SOURSE, and to Panera Bread. Cindy's suggestion to visit a local cafe ACME ended up as a real treat. Also - Great walking in the hills through the neighborhoods. Cindy is a great host - very responsive - yet left us to our quiet time relaxing in the nook. Having the gas fireplace was a wonderful amenity for early morning or late evening warm up and to just snuggle near on the sooo comfortable sofa."
19388806,332188321,2018-10-04,79735649,Mike,A great place with a great host.
19388806,333060689,2018-10-06,8727665,Wendy,Good value. Nice and sweet. Quiet.

19388806,344496968,2018-11-03,4924891,Charles,"This is listed as a private room, but it's basically your own house.  There's a private entrance through the garage, then you have an open bedroom/livingroom area, bathroom, and a  laundry, kitchen, sauna area.  You just don't have an  oven.  If you're okay with eating out or cooking in a microwave, then this would be a great place to stay for a week or more. So much better than a hotel, for less money."
19388806,345341099,2018-11-04,112165077,Jane,Perfect for the night
19388806,348648358,2018-11-14,224846766,Amanda,Our stay was perfect! Very clean and super comfy.  This was my first time trying an Airbnb and I don't think we could have done better.  Thank you Cindy!

19388806,363457471,2018-12-28,173688723,Emily,"Cindy’s place is like your very own cozy little basement apartment. The fireplace warms the whole space, there’s a sweet little kitchenette with a washer and dryer, AND a sauna! Best AirBnB ever, in my opinion. You can hear noises from upstairs, but I slept right through them so, unless you’re a really light sleeper it’s no problem. You’ll be glad to call it home for a couple nights."

19388806,404349414,2019-01-23,57820866,Jeanne,"What a lovely relaxing private space. Airbnb'ers who want a little personal space will appreciate the separate entrance and plenty of room. I especially loved the gas fireplace on a cold night! Yes, early on in the evening I could hear a little activity from up above but it wasn't an issue - just what sounded like someone making dinner then nothing; I slept like a baby! Wish I'd had time to use the sauna - wow!"
19388806,405768214,2019-01-27,21024127,Randi,"Great space! Warm feel, spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. The sauna was amazing! Location was within walking distance to the workshop I was in town for. I enjoyed  a nice walk through the neighborhood to/from the workshop, had lunch on the back patio during my breaks on the sunny days, and relaxed by the fireplace in the private room each evening. It was a nice respite and I felt right at home for a few days! I would definitely stay here again."

19388806,417015996,2019-02-25,228416430,Thom &  Holly,"I really did enjoy the Fire place and I did make use of the sauna such a treat.!!
So nice to work all day and comeback to such a relaxing space.  Thank You so much.

I did take a picture of the snow at about 2 to 3 inches in the morning and I guess I did not send the pick as It did not apear in the text message.   oops.

If I have forgotten any thing just ""sell it and send the money"" truly did love the space.

19388806,453785631,2019-05-16,52711838,Eddie,Cindy’s nook has everything you need and more. I was stopping through town on business and she responded quickly and made sure I was able to access the unit without issue. The sauna was awesome and the fireplace kept me plenty warm on a cold night. This was my first time using Airbnb for a private room in someone’s home and I must say Cindy exceeded my expectations.

We had bigger plans for our time in Salem, but what we found was rest and respite. The space is very comfortable, very well thought out, and there are tons of little (and big!) touches to the space that you can't help but feel at home. And you don't see too many Airbnbs with a sauna in them, either. If you're in Salem and this suite is free, just book it!"

19388806,573294963,2019-12-05,118902605,Keith,Cindy is a nice and thoughtful host. I often travel to the Salem area for work and always stay at Cindy’s Place; it’s just right for me
19388806,575316562,2019-12-09,196292934,Andrew,This is a fantastic place to stay in Salem. It’s in a very accessible location for the capital or Willamette University. Cindy has a great space with amenities I haven’t seen in an air bnb before (hello indoor sauna ). The neighborhood is accessible yet very quiet. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
19388806,575923330,2019-12-11,296794161,Kimberly,"Lovely, private space. Comfortable and quiet."

19388806,591625595,2020-01-11,77982346,Kristyna,"A quiet and cozy space. Definitely take advantage of the wonderful sauna! The bed is super comfortable and the host has added thoughtful touches. When we grew weary of traveling in a hard rain, we requested a last-minute stay and Cindy responded in minutes. We were grateful to have stumbled across this peaceful spot!"
19388806,593080174,2020-01-14,103375049,Amanda,"Cindy's place was wonderful!  I had planned to get dinner out, and decided on take out instead to have more time enjoying the cozy space.  The privacy was wonderful, the sauna incredibly relaxing, and the whole space was really inviting.  I bed was comfortable, the shower hot, and there were lovely, thoughtful touches.  I would absolutely stay again."
19388806,593370686,2020-01-15,996357,Alexandra,"This is a little gem! Actually even feels much bigger than the pictures show. Each space is so clean, and roomy, and cute! Cindy is very easy to get in touch with and the location is walking distance to restaurants, which was nice."
19388806,594083565,2020-01-17,174500733,Megan,"We loved our stay! The suite was beautifully decorated and cozy. The fireplace warmed up the room for our arrival and the sauna was very nice. Cindy had clear instructions for check in, operating the sauna, and check out. There were cold water bottles in the fridge as well as muffins and yogurt for breakfast. Thank you, Cindy for your kind hospitality!"
19388806,595147535,2020-01-19,3626066,Sherri,"Cindys place was a great little basement apartment, it’s beautifully decorated, very clean and even had the fire in the fireplace going for our arrival."
19388806,595780604,2020-01-20,299967633,Evan,"This is an amazing place! Everything was sparkling clean and it was a comfortable, neat, and well decorated. Cindy is a very hospitable host and it is obvious she puts a lot of work into making this a great stay for guests. I would definitely recommend staying here! 
Oh, and of course the sauna in the suite was an awesome touch!"
19388806,597136011,2020-01-24,192576258,Jessica,"Inviting space w tasteful decor and thoughtful amenities (bite size snickers before bed is always special!). Yes, it's a basement space but the decor is clean & bright...has a fireplace insert that heats the space quickly, has a sauna, & the private bathroom is a plus  for the price range! Very nice stay. Would stay again!"
19388806,598284567,2020-01-26,86339895,Brian,"Possibly the best Air BNB property Ive been to so far! The Sauna is steamy, the bed comfy, and the fireplace fiery! 

Amazing stay, you won’t want to leave,
Plan and extra day!"

19388806,601059354,2020-02-02,76863795,Erica,"What a lovely, relaxing little space! It was perfect for a night away to unwind. I especially enjoyed the fireplace and cozy comfortable living space. I didn’t have a chance to try out the sauna, but what a fun option. I suppose I’ll need to come back for another night and give it a try! Cindy was excellent about communication and responded quickly when I had a question. Overall, I was really pleased and would definitely recommend a stay at Cindy’s Nook!"
19388806,602750949,2020-02-07,160795697,Brittany,Cindy has thought of everything!!!! She has such a lovely home! It made being away from mine a bit easier. I would love to stay again.
19388806,603166066,2020-02-08,179679624,Sara,"Cindy's place is beautiful and peaceful, you won't regret staying with her!"
19388806,606846565,2020-02-16,93684382,Eric,Quaint place to relax and not far from downtown Salem.  Clean.  Cindy is very responsive and interested in guests having a pleasant stay.
19388806,607790236,2020-02-18,2874013,Rosalyn,"Cindy is a very gracious host.  Her clear communication made it easy to settle into her place. Cindy has made a multi use space intro a charming, comfortable place. She is obviously anxious to ensure her guests’ comfort. And she has succeeded. I’m glad I found Cindy’s and will certainly stay there again."
19388806,608459084,2020-02-20,130074848,Megan,"Wonderfully relaxing place to stay. Super comfy bed, gas fireplace -- a Finnish sauna!!! Honestly, it's the trifecta of comfort factors. Everything was great, and the owner went out of her way to accommodate me with a last-minute booking."
19388806,608905592,2020-02-21,21621360,Karen,This is such a gem. The sauna is great and the place is beautifully appointed and decorated. We had a great night sleep. Lots of lovely little touches like little snicker bars on the bedside tables and a lovely little breakfast in the morning. What a great find!
19388806,610619488,2020-02-24,228416430,Thom &  Holly,This is a perfect place just as described Sana and fireplace make it warm and cozy

19388806,619271744,2020-03-16,253007497,Jody,"What a nice surprise. The unit is the lower level of Cindy’s home, conveniently located in a nice older residential area. It is private, with a comfortable queen bed, fireplace, and even a sauna. We will stay there again if our travels take us to Salem."
19388806,620553047,2020-03-22,17829253,Ben,"Very cozy venue, the fireplace adds a great ambiance as well as heat. I fully recommend this place and would return again."
19388806,622428372,2020-04-14,23676633,Em,"Cindy's Nook was comfortable and provided good amenities, even for an extended stay of more than two weeks. The basement apartment was nonetheless bright and cheery, and even featured an enjoyable garden view. Coffee was provided initially, as were a few breakfast, as promised, in the kitchenette area. This provided a microwave and small refrigerator. A utility sink is also available for washing up. The kitchenette shares space with the washer and dryer -- very convenient situation. 

The neighborhood is very quiet, and comfortable for walking. There are restaurants and groceries nearby. It was nice to have occasional neighborly chats with Cindy, regarding amenities that the area has to offer. The property itself has reall nice gardening touches, and a very welcoming back deck area.

Cindy's Nook was a welcome transition point, in our move from Ohio to Salem area."
19388806,628562436,2020-06-08,17429365,Ted,Fantastic setting. Beautiful yard. Incredible apartment. Even had a sauna! How can you go wrong? I look forward to staying here again sometime.

19388806,633127153,2020-06-28,178348067,Rodney,"This is a wonderful, quiet, centrally located home that is perfect for a weekend getaway! The host replies quickly and provides assistance if ever needed to make your stay the very BEST!"
19388806,634312113,2020-07-03,5246530,Matthew,"A lovely, quiet space with lots of thoughtful touches. The sauna was impeccable and really made our time there feel special."
19388806,636554692,2020-07-10,172183209,Petro,"This place was so clean and also so private ,that was amazing !
Thank you Cindy for great stay."
19388806,645366433,2020-08-01,27099469,Marcus,Exactly what I was looking for!
19388806,646035635,2020-08-02,257879367,Tara,We had a great stay! Very spacious and clean. Cindy was very responsive and provided some nice touches. Loved the privacy of a separate entrace and cozy back yard.
19388806,646474753,2020-08-03,350559935,Drake,Quiet place with easy access and clean amenities and the sauna is awesome
19388806,648418230,2020-08-08,82909527,Margaret,"We needed a quick place to rest on a long drive. Cindy was quick to communicate and provided a clean, lovely place to stay. Check-in instructions were clear and easy. Wish we had time to spend in Cindy’s nice garden!"
19388806,653242623,2020-08-18,118879087,Kyungsig Samuel,A clean and decent space. Very cool in the summer time. This is a half basement. I stayed for 7 days and met my need.
19388806,658753815,2020-08-30,230712880,Alicia,"Cute, comfy, quiet, and very cozy. Slept very well!"

This is my first time booking with Airbnb, and i am impressed.
Clean,quit,overall great experience."
19388806,659484317,2020-09-01,268123008,Matt,Great place in a quiet spot. The garden and amenities are amazing. Would stay again.
19388806,662212117,2020-09-08,207658069,Heather,"Clean, stylish and very convenient to all that I needed.  Beautiful garden was so welcoming."
19388806,665472124,2020-09-18,184429402,Patrick,"From the moment you walk in the door you are in an incredibly welcoming space. Very comfortable bed, a nice fireplace, and the highlight of course is the sauna! The space is clean, the contactless aspect with Covid precautions is flawless and awhile we never interacted with Cindy, the little touches will make you feel right at home."
19388806,669428141,2020-09-29,367699329,Nicole,"Very beautiful, but no breakfast."
19388806,702400086,2020-10-20,339872216,Leslee,A quiet place to rest and relax.  Highly recommend!
19394840,166168442,2017-07-02,38562446,Megan,"I only got to stay one night, but it's a perfect little sanctuary, and the hosts were quite nice. I wish I had more time to have enjoyed reading in the hammock by the river."
19394840,172062772,2017-07-19,126649108,Tu Anh,The room has a nice view and the location is close to where I was going to. However the owner has cats and the litterbox was close by which made the room smell bad.
19394840,172404608,2017-07-20,11696653,Colleen,"Unique ambiance, super comfortable bed, excellent shower. Waking up to the view of the creek and koi pond outside the window was delightful. Hosts were accomodating and gave great location instructions. We felt well cared for!"
19394840,173735344,2017-07-23,34998525,Linda,"An absolutely peaceful and lovely place. Nate and Renee have decorated with comfortable and interesting pieces, including a cushy corner for enjoying Roku.  Many thoughtful touches, and an enchanting spot along the creek with a beautiful pond and garden. The room is large and private; two friendly cats will stop by to say hello."
19394840,175395332,2017-07-28,39381468,Mike And Jill,Super fun place to stay with an incredible outdoor setting. Very roomy with private entrance & bathroom. We loved the boho chic decorating. Nate & Renee were super nice & friendly too! 
19394840,176381103,2017-07-30,136823869,Laramie,"Great place to stay with a lot of space and clean rooms. Not recommended for anyone over 6'3 because the ceilings are pretty low. Our tall friend hit his head a few times, other than that it was awesome!"
19394840,178534922,2017-08-05,10948649,Ellen,The room is very large and includes multiple couches/love seats to relax on.  Microwave and refrigerator provided in the room which was very nice.  I loved the essential oil diffuser--wonderful smells.  The room looks out on a pond with interesting fish and a canal with ducks floating by.  Very quiet and peaceful.
19394840,179129470,2017-08-06,24200672,Philippine,We only stayed a night and surely had stayed longer if we could. It was perfect for our two girls and us. Thank you again nate!
19394840,179544728,2017-08-07,32643852,Sarah,"This beautiful space is so relaxing! We were there on a 100 degree day - and the basement room stayed nice and cool. The decor is beautiful and unique. So many artistic touches to enjoy here! The outdoor are with koi pond and lazy river is just gorgeous. The koi pond itself is like a little fairy land, it was fun to look through all the whimsical decor in that area. The bed was nice and firm, very comfortable for my husband and I to share. There is also a nice day bed that our teenager slept on. There's an overstuffed loveseat that was so comfortable and cute. We used the kitchen facilities for our meals, I felt a little guilty that I didn't have a sponge and dish soap to clean up after myself but they were not provided. The shower and tub had good water pressure and an instant-hot tank, in a very pretty little bathroom. 

We chose to interact with the cats, which is optional, and they were GREAT cats! Very loving, friendly, cute, soft, and playful! The cats were a big perk for our family! 
Thank you for sharing this beautiful home with us! We'll be back!"
19394840,183271706,2017-08-16,144719885,Tobias,Nice room and beautiful setting! Plenty of amenities and walking distance to downtown. We wish we had more time to relax in the absolutely gorgeous creek side back yard which the room looks out onto. We also thoroughly enjoyed a visit from two super sweet kitty cats! Don't worry they can be kept out of the room easily. It did not affect our stay negatively but there were no blinds/curtains for dark/privacy if that kind of thing is important to you. There aren't streets or neighbors on that side of the house so it still felt plenty comfortable. Good value and a great feel over all. It was our first airbnb experience and we had zero regrets! Thanks Nate and Renee!
19394840,186176090,2017-08-23,144336200,Laurie,The view out the window is special. The river and nice landscaping make it a unique place to stay. Communicating with the owners went smoothly- it was an easy process.
19394840,187863700,2017-08-27,43898719,Cyrena,"MAGICAL!!! The water, the crystals, the cats, the people! Highly recommended. "
19394840,191255638,2017-09-06,5023454,Carole,"The outside is tranquil and lovely! Beautiful trees and shrubs.  Safe area, though a bit hard to find initially!"
19394840,192675843,2017-09-10,82486826,Luis,Perfect space for our stay while visiting family.
19394840,193734907,2017-09-14,148440099,Laura,Spot was great.  I had just arrived after an extremely long trip and enjoyed the quiet and calm setting.  I spent most of my time sleeping and the bed was comfy.
19394840,194917375,2017-09-17,36890406,Jeremy,"Really special place:  beautifully situated on the banks of Mill Creek, private entrance, private bathroom, and lots of natural light.  Super friendly hosts made the stay easy & chill.  Was just what we needed in visiting Salem/Willamette, I only wish we could have stayed longer."
19394840,196040180,2017-09-21,16049843,Frances,"Nice room with an outstanding view / patio. The temperature was perfectly cozy and the host left a nice treat for me.  It was a quick commute to the Salem Convention Center which was very convenient.  Only advice is that if you are sensitive to smells this might not be a good fit for you.  There is a cat litter box smell present in the hall that connects to the bathroom.  The space has lots of oil diffusers, air fresheners, and scents in general.  Not a deal breaker for me but I realize some people are sensitive to this kind of thing."
19394840,200247769,2017-10-04,11741334,Megan,"This is a great spot on a creek with a comfortable double and day bed, and small kitchenette.  The hosts were very nice, and we enjoyed our short stay there.  The litter box was in the common space between the bedroom and bathroom, and it was pretty smelly.  Other than that, we loved the place."
19394840,200522232,2017-10-05,32289340,Beverly,"Very conveniently located if you have business in the central part of Salem. We really enjoyed spending time on the deck watching the ducks, squirrels and stellar jays.  The trees were fantastic.  We especially appreciated the attention Renee gave us when we arrived and spending time with her while she chubbed the ""wild life"" with peanuts and us with wine.  Thanks much."
19394840,201149787,2017-10-07,10015240,Carole,"A relaxed atmosphere among the trees is nice to have conveniently located close to the busy-ness of Salem. The intimate waterfront view is lovely - and we were assured that there were no views into the uncurtained window at night.  You need to be aware of the presence of two sweet cats if you have sensitivities. The beds were comfortable, the hosts responsive and friendly."
19394840,202301950,2017-10-10,7291241,Karen,Nice place tucked away off the main road in a quiet neighborhood.  Nice view out the back to the creek.  Very comfortable bed.  The hosts were not friendly and never spoke to us except to be upset that we were there 15 min early even though we has messaged them to ask if it was ok.  The hallway smelled of cat urine and when I was in the bathroom a cat must have come in our room and peed on my clothes which was very unpleasant.
19394840,202537656,2017-10-11,45170173,Smadar,Great!
19394840,203014300,2017-10-13,154340318,Kate,Great view; serene.
19394840,204164380,2017-10-16,2935370,Brad & Claire,"Comfy, thoughtful, welcoming. Tucked into a quiet lane beside Salem's old Mill Creek, this is a great spot. Excellent communication and hospitality."
19394840,204567780,2017-10-18,8564024,Cynthia,"The space is perfectly laid out - spacious and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  There was good coffee and oatmeal and fruit for the morning.  The hosts were friendly and gracious.  Most remarkable, is that the accommodation is a private suite with a separate entrance and an absolutely spectacular view right on Mill Creek, with mature oaks and cottonwoods.  Though I was just avoiding an evening work commute, it felt like a mini-vacation."
19394840,205028503,2017-10-20,148130261,Laura,We LOVED this place. Very beautiful and peaceful spot right in town. Nate & Renee are very friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends. 
19394840,205774783,2017-10-22,109883231,Stephanie,Beautiful view out the window. Location was easy to get to.  We enjoyed our stay and the two cats that are very sweet.
19394840,207680479,2017-10-29,38036690,Joshua,"This beautiful home has everything you'd need for a wonderful and comfortable stay in Salem, OR. I would gladly return and recommend this place to anyone. 5 stars all-around!"
19394840,208955557,2017-11-03,2935370,Brad & Claire,"Lovely spot by the Mill Creek, minutes from the center of Salem. Part of what I love about Salem is that it has these secret gems. The town has an open-handed, small-town vibe, friendly, and neighborhoods like this one that are secluded and beautiful. Nate's a welcoming and thoughtful host, and the cats are good company when they come to visit."
19394840,209200805,2017-11-04,116160396,Michelle,We stayed at Nate’s place to visit Willamette. Very good location and he has a beautiful garden overlooking the Mill Stream. Comfortable and clean.
19394840,209716928,2017-11-05,143998200,Rick,Beautiful view of the water
19394840,210319196,2017-11-08,81158609,Vincent,"Love this place! The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable in every way.  Nate was friendly and very accomodating. I enjoyed looking at all the frame artwork that was displayed in the room. If I would, I would give this place 6 out of 5 stars."
19394840,210473718,2017-11-09,7175062,Marsha,"We enjoyed our stay here--especially meeting the two friendly cats!  The room and bed are comfortable, and the view of the stream and trees from the picture window was a plus.  Because the room is in the basement, it's near the furnace, which is a bit noisy.  But for just one night, that's fine.  We also appreciated the selection of teas and other items for breakfast."
19394840,212022399,2017-11-15,81158609,Vincent,"Love Nate's place, had to come back for a second time  during my stay in Salem.  Clean and comforting as usual.  Thanks again Nate!"
19394840,212212858,2017-11-16,312350,Susan,"This is a lovely place, private and peaceful.  I would recommend it.  Our communication was great, and I enjoyed meeting the beautiful cats.  Many thanks for the good vibes and clean, sweet room on the creek.  Susan"
19394840,215428746,2017-11-29,53487538,Steven,"Very good location -- not far from Willamette University, the state capitol, and downtown Salem -- plus it's on a quiet street and the property backs to a creek. For us the two house cats were a bonus because we're cat owners, and the hosts were very nice."
19394840,216803712,2017-12-05,160640538,Nicholas,Great location with a beautiful morning view of Mill Creek. Both days on my stay I woke up to many ducks and squirrels in the backyard with a beautiful river and mossy trees in the background. The space was great and had everything I needed for a work trip. The only downside to the stay was that you can very easily hear the hosts walking around upstairs early in the morning as the floor squeaks/creaks. If you're a light sleeper like me bring your own or request earplugs from Nate as this solved the problem.
19394840,217095364,2017-12-07,9565393,John,Easy checkin. Comfy bed and lots of space.
19394840,217299081,2017-12-08,8207640,Emily,"Everything was as advertised! Cozy, clean place with friendly hosts and great communication. We would stay here again."
19394840,218749363,2017-12-14,161902709,William,"Nate’s place is a block and a half from a superb, down home omelette house, close to downtown Salem, the freeway, and a shopping mall, and yet it feels like you are out in the woods at the same time. 

Highly recommended.  Oh, Nate and Renee are great, too."
19394840,227429053,2018-01-14,25194632,Travis,"This is a great spot with soothing views of running water & ducks. Nate & Renee were super thoughtful with their meticulous attention to detail. There was coffee, a toaster, small fridge, even an ironing board for some last minute touches on a dress shirt. We highly recommend Nate & Renee's place to future AirBnB guests :)"
19394840,228448263,2018-01-19,24680737,Rod,"Easy in & out, comfy, clean space, nice touches like a bottle of wine and coffee. Good place to stay!"
19394840,230253111,2018-01-27,22613169,Jennifer,Nate & Renee’s place was perfect! We arrived kind of late and Nate escorted us to our secluded creek side room. There is a furnace and fridge that come on periodically but it becomes just white noise after a bit. Everything was clean and comfortable. The creek in the morning is especially lovely. Waking up with the ducks and squirrels while enjoy a morning coffee was extremely satisfying! Thank you so much! My niece enjoyed the bath tub and I enjoyed the welcoming meditative space. Would definitely book again!
19394840,233046116,2018-02-07,59064786,Phil,Awesome place! Almost like I'm at my own house. This place is definitely on my list if I ever get back to Salem!
19394840,233473566,2018-02-09,2163799,Sean,"Amazingly, this place is both central and tranquil. Loved the location, loved the space, loved the cats. I can't wait to stay again."
19394840,235737444,2018-02-17,121031019,Robbie,5 stars
19394840,236274476,2018-02-18,121031019,Robbie,"Clean, affordable bottom level of a fantastic home. Hosts were amazing, communicated timely and the space had everything 1 - 2 people could want. You want to rent this place!"
19394840,239656070,2018-03-02,175340458,Kristi,"This is a lovely private place to stay, while still being quite close to the University where I was visiting."
19394840,240694342,2018-03-05,36267709,Leia,"Renee and Nate (and their cats) were super sweet and welcoming.  Check-in was easy, and they provided great information about the area and pamphlets of things to do.
The room was good size with various sleeping options, and a very pleasant view of a creek.  I was concerned by the resident ducks and geese on banks, but they were surprisingly non-vocal.  
Best of all the location is in walking distance of breakfast options, and cycling distance to downtown.

I'd definitely recommend staying with Renee and Nate. :)"
19394840,241123790,2018-03-07,119688492,Rosa,Both Nate and Renee were super nice !!! Great home - cool kittens :) beautiful scene from the window- we will be bAck for sure.
19394840,241878165,2018-03-10,41962602,Lyndsay,This place was great. Private entrance is nice and couldn’t really hear anything from the rest of the house. The nature/animal kingdom out the back is amazing!! We loved watching the squirrels and ducks each morning. :)
19394840,242660215,2018-03-12,18179556,Kimberley,"Tucked into a small neighborhood which backs up to Mill Creek. The room is inviting, and the big picture window allows you to watch the world go by if it's cold and rainy. The back patio/garden is serene and we spent each evening we were there outdoors with a glass of wine, enjoying the evening. During the morning you have ducks and squirrels and the occasional goose. The bed was comfy, the shower worked well, and having a fridge was great. Nate and Renee are a lovely couple, and we hope to stay with them next time we are in Salem."
19394840,243972718,2018-03-17,176842740,Kelly,"This is a nice, quiet and serene space. My daughter and I loved to watch the ducks and geese at the river front from the large picture window. We were visiting Willamette Univ. and were only 5 minutes or so away from campus."
19394840,244850983,2018-03-19,128307186,Jenny,"Nice place! I had a very short stay there (less than 12 hours!). The space has nice amenities including a TV, lounge area, mini fridge, microwave and sink. The location is perfect for business at the Capital. There's a coffee shop on the corner and a breakfast place across the street. Then a nice, flat 1 mile walk to the Capital."
19394840,245779370,2018-03-23,9565393,John,Great hosts.
19394840,249179710,2018-04-01,2603215,Xavier Dayanandh,"Nate & Renee have a wonderful home, arranged beautifully for guests. 
The room is nice and spacious and has all the amenities needed, the private bath is also very clean and stocked with immediate necessities. Everything was nice and clean, we truly relaxed during our stay here! The place is also very close to restaurants and we did a bit of trotting around as well!"
19394840,250598141,2018-04-05,134667089,Thomas & Angela,"Very close to downtown Salem, so not a shortage on things to see. We were just passing through so it was a good stop. Beautiful backyard with ducks walking around! Their cats are sweethearts but do hang around for while haha."
19394840,252457417,2018-04-10,148839818,Christophe,"This space is a great little hideaway.  Aside from the riverside atmosphere and wildlife (ducks, geese, squirrels, etc.), my favorite part was the decor.  Nate & Renee have great taste and this is a great home away from home.  Their recommendations for reliable eateries are worth checking out too."
19394840,254461811,2018-04-16,54522847,David,"Great place, wonderful wildlife views and setting, private bathroom, a separate entry, artful decorations, a very restful location close to town - what more could you ask for!"
19394840,257563688,2018-04-26,179626210,Karen,"Nate & Renee were great hosts, very friendly. The back yard is beautiful like an oasis. Excellent location."
19394840,260710782,2018-05-04,24227157,Twyla,Private with a beautiful peaceful view! Lots of little items available if you need them! Recommendations for local trips or places to eat!
19394840,261023196,2018-05-05,108783798,Steve,"Lots of space, very quiet location; easy distance to Salem attractions.   Private bath is great.   Lots of eclectic style."
19394840,262404269,2018-05-08,2163799,Sean,This was my second stay with Nate and Renee. I love the tranquility of the place. I will stay here again.
19394840,265073358,2018-05-15,46886568,Joseph,"Beautiful place with quiet, peaceful creekside location. Bed(s) were comfortable, but not much space to set suitcases or other items. Private entry and ability to come and go as we pleased was appreciated, as was parking space. Only real issue was the offensive odors in the laundry room area on the way to our bathroom. Still not too bad of a deal for the price."
19394840,268709607,2018-05-25,127545790,Tyson,"Amazingly beautiful place to stay. The backyard was a dream and the accommodations were great. We loved the atmosphere and felt right at home. We came in late at night and the hosts ensured we were able to access the room with no complications while offering help at any hour if we needed. We are excited to stay here again in the future. We were only a little disappointed in not getting to see the cats, we love animals, but this does not impact the quality of our stay. Thank you so much for hosting us! "
19394840,269623251,2018-05-27,59535666,Brentye,Their place was very comfy and cute. Renee gave us a little tour when we arrived and was super welcoming. She was very communicative and quick to address any issues we were having.
19394840,278347951,2018-06-17,98065902,Tim,"Very private. Beautiful view out the large window. I got to watch green herons fledge, and a raccoon fishing in the fishpond."
19394840,278749573,2018-06-18,96104977,Josh,"Nate and Renee have a super tranquil, private spot right on a creek. It’s absolutely beautiful! We didn’t get a chance to meet Renee but Nate was awesome, super friendly, and as a transplant himself has a ton of local insight. The space is very clean and has good energy, I would definitely stay here again!"
19394840,280253456,2018-06-22,138603045,Adam,"Nate and Renee’s room was very comfortable. The amenities were superb and the view was stunning. They two lovable cats came down for a visit and were just the sweetest animals. They sent me a note the morning of the reservation with the details of how to enter and other general information which was really helpful. 

Thank you Nate and Renee for being amazing! I’d definitely stay here again."
19394840,281839282,2018-06-25,51517977,Erin,"Nate and Renee are such wonderful, warm, and welcoming hosts! Their outdoor space is amazing, and there's so much peace and comfort in sitting by the river. :) I just stayed one night while in Salem to take a standardized professional exam, but it was a lovely place to be. I only slept well about half the night, but that was totally due to nerves, rather than the place. Once I did fall asleep, I woke up comfy and peaceful. I was there during the water advisory, and Renee was so thoughtful about giving me tons of bottled water. You also get to be surrounded by Nate's beautiful artwork. "
19394840,282587259,2018-06-27,8512156,Pim,Amazing place! Huge room with everything you need. It's clean and close to the good places to eat. 30 mins drive from Silver Falls (highly recommended if you like hiking!). Both Nate and Renee are super nice people and are there for you to make sure you feel at home. Highly recommended if you want to explore Salem or on your way to Portland and need to make a pitstop for a night. Lovely people with a great garden and cats :) We loved the squirrels in the morning.
19394840,282946518,2018-06-28,177647311,Ryan,"This is a great one night or two night stay if you're road tripping or have official business in the city. Private entrance was great, accessibility to the laundry was priority for us and a private bathroom is a must for my wife.
Close enough to drive to the City Center or there are two great restaurants within walking distance of the house."
19394840,288415190,2018-07-09,194173555,Kathryn,Definitely a special place to stay with all amenities needed.  Peaceful place right on a small river with ducks and even geese floating by. Special touches make this a perfect retreat.
19394840,288804458,2018-07-10,200315806,Shane,Good place to stay for a night when traveling through the area.  Nate was on sight when we arrived and was very personable and friendly.  Backyard was very cozy.
19394840,295555851,2018-07-23,116111565,Andrea,This stay was wonderful. The cats were great and they even had a bottle of wine waiting for me ! Renee even offered to take me wine tasting. Lovely people lovely stay <3 
19394840,302610598,2018-08-05,169560445,Randall,Really cozy and clean space. Beautiful art on the walls and friendly cats. Perfect for a quick stay and Renee is really easy going
19394840,306615603,2018-08-12,204993970,Roberta,"Step through the 'purple gate' and your time there will transform you! The grounds are beautiful and quite magical especially at night!  The space inside is quite peaceful as well, and the little extras make you feel at home. I loved having Zeka and Rumi visit as well. All well thought out, worth a visit! "
19394840,307606128,2018-08-14,183232439,Jill,"GREAT VALUE, STYLISH, and CHARMING OUTDOOR SPACE! I had a chance to meet Nate and Renee and they both were very communicative and provided outstanding hospitality.  I enjoyed some visits with their cats who made me feel right at home.  You don’t have to visit with the cats though if it’s not your thing or you just want some privacy....just keep the door between your room and the laundry room closed.  I slept very well and the shower was hot.  I appreciated all the artwork and how it gave the place a warm and homey feel.  It was nice to have a view of the koi pond and the creek...I enjoyed seeing some ducks one day.  It was also beneficial for me to have a washer/dryer to do a load of laundry.  For everything you’re getting, it was such a great value!  I loved visiting Silver Falls State Park...what a gem!"
19394840,309154585,2018-08-17,100672033,Shamu,"What a wonderful place to stay! The room itself is cozy, spacious, and decorated so beautifully. The backyard that overlooks a small river/creek is pure bliss. A 5 minute stroll around the yard will soothe your soul to serenity. Not exaggerating."
19394840,309749475,2018-08-18,121579062,Emily,Great comfortable place to stay! Nate greeted me and even provided a new toothbrush since I had forgotten mine. 
19394840,312582018,2018-08-23,2412996,Julie,"It was lovely to stay with my children in Renee and Nate's place. It was very private, with a lovely garden overlooking the river - nice to listen to at night. The beds were super comfy, and we adored their two playful and affectionate cats. The house is located in a very quiet spot about an $8 uber/lyft ride from the university campus."
19394840,313664858,2018-08-25,205136381,Kelly,Beautiful garden area.
19394840,314504936,2018-08-26,201650396,Annette,Expect to be enchanted when you stay with Nate and Renee. Their home is a beautiful little cottage on the river and has so many artistic touches...I felt like I was staying at a Magic Fairy Land. The backyard and the koi pond is lit up at night with beautiful little lights. I loved being entertained by Zeka and Rumi. I felt very comfortable and plan to return.
19394840,315410921,2018-08-28,51020441,Mark,"Awesome place to stay! The back yard, is beautiful. The location is great."
19394840,317816858,2018-09-02,203534708,Kelly,Very serene with the creek running along the back yard. The location is a bit further into a older neighborhood but it was quite and the bus stops are very convenient.  I enjoyed walking into the downtown area which took about 30 minutes but it is pleasant and an Uber ride is only a 5 minute ride. Amtrak station is clean and convenient.  The Plaid Pantry across the street had plenty to offer for snacks and a light meal. The State Street Grill had inexpensive drinks and I met and got to know the locals. They had pretty darn good food for a modest price. The bathroom was super clean and lovely and stocked with anything you might need. I hope I have a chance to go back.
19394840,319927648,2018-09-07,65089363,Genora,"Nate and Renee have a wonderful home! They are very responsive and thoughtful, and have adorable (if a touch nosey) cats. Best of all, the backyard has a koi pond and is right near a little stream! Very cute and relaxing."
19394840,337265994,2018-10-15,63013873,Dale,This is a great spot located close to the heart of Salem.
19394840,351138374,2018-11-21,97002253,Tamera,"darling place, wish we could have stayed longer in the day to enjoy the beautiful view of the river."
19394840,361069947,2018-12-22,176678927,Sam,everything was amazing
19394840,400337512,2019-01-11,227556702,Raymond,Everything was as described in Nate and Renee’s ad and even exceeded my expectations. I had all the privacy I needed and plenty of space. They had just about everything you’d need if you forgot to pack something. They are quick to respond when you need to contact them. I would definitely recommend staying and would stay again myself.
19394840,401504693,2019-01-14,235103102,Edith,Peaceful place to stay.
19394840,401949316,2019-01-16,98736533,Alan,Wonderful space just as described. Great communication from the host. Couldn’t ask for more.
19394840,402213796,2019-01-17,110692390,Star,Very comfortable place. Clear communication. Lovely view of the river.  It was a nice alternative to the typical business hotel stay options. Great value. Exactly as described.

19394840,404351712,2019-01-23,2825234,Elly,"Very unique space, feels like a home away from home. The view and back yard is so lovely, full of beautiful touches. We really enjoyed our stay!"
19394840,404602259,2019-01-24,200934829,Kendall,Great place to stay!
19394840,410174188,2019-02-09,565936,Helen,This is a sweet little place with an amazing location.  Right on the river.  Lovely patio tho it was too cold for me to enjoy it. Just the right amount of space for a short holiday or to turn a short work trip into something more fun. There was a rope swing so summer is bound to be fun there.
19394840,413640696,2019-02-17,240491695,Dan,"Pros:
- Nate was a gracious enough host to give me a pair of socks after I had forgotten mine.  It was 8am and he was very happy to help me out!  THANK YOU!
- Amazing space.
- Beautiful scenic space with a garden and a calm river
- Gorgeous artwork on the walls. It's clear that this family appreciates artistic design
- Great central location

Cons:
- Twin sized bed. Luckily I was staying alone, but if I were with somebody, this could get a little cramped
- Hot water doesn't last long unfortunately
- When using the toilet/shower, the water pump in the bathroom sounds like a car starting.  Trying to be quiet while taking care of personal business made me a little conscious as I didn't want to disturb Nate & Renee early in the morning.
- 1-ply toilet paper"
19394840,414470925,2019-02-19,29233453,Julia,Such a relaxing and beautifully decorated  space with so much attention to detail.
19394840,415103893,2019-02-21,110692390,Star,"My second stay.  Clear communication. Comfortable place. Beautiful view of the river.  It was fun to watch the a.m. wildlife activity in the backyard - various aerial birds, ducks, and a squirrel. Excellent alternative to the typical business hotel stay. Great value. Exactly as described."
19394840,415465918,2019-02-22,104235294,David,"Was exactly what I needed. And I got to pet a cat, which is pretty cool."

19394840,421554467,2019-03-09,77817236,Margaret,"Nate & Renee have an amazing home for a great value with lots of adorable animals all around! The river sounds peaceful, the fish are fun to watch, and their kitties are super cute, cuddly, and playful. They were both very friendly and have decorated the space with the perfect combination of comforting and colorful. I will definitely consider staying here again the next time I am in Salem!"
19394840,426652775,2019-03-21,208880866,Angelina,"Renee was amazing, I loved the room and the view/outdoor area was beautiful. It was soo relaxing "

19394840,431800324,2019-04-01,31413771,Lynn,"Sweet room, better than described. They have several very thoughtful touches. Nice toiletries. Very clean. Sleeps 2; 3 would’ve be a bit too cozy. Separate entrance makes for a nice private setting. 
Relaxing, quiet neighborhood. Close to Capitol, Willamette University and a zillion government buildings, including the Oregon Star Penitentiary."
19394840,432082834,2019-04-02,76947098,Emily,"Easy, quaint, cute view of the river. I’d stay here again."
19394840,433093719,2019-04-05,125163405,Jennah,"The room has a private entrance in the back of the house, so coming and going on your own schedule is easy"
19394840,435894587,2019-04-11,981057,Chrissy,"Great location near the river and good options for food and beverages. Nate’s suggestion of Salem Ale Works was just what we need- great food and beer! As a light sleeper, the noise from the heating system was only con. Overall, great hostesses!!"

The river is so peaceful at night and the cats are absolutely adorable! I would love to stay here any time I’m in Salem. Highly recommend!"
19394840,464102568,2019-06-04,19034375,Sangye,"Beautiful spot along a creek, walking distance from downtown Salem. Welcoming hosts, and very sweet cats. I don’t think there’s a better deal in Salem."
19394840,466940079,2019-06-09,78019763,Mia,This home is on a beautiful  creek near downtown Salem.  The rental area is cozy and comfortable and there has been a lot of work put in to make it a lush green paradise!  It is close to local restaurant options and the hosts are helpful and kind. Great place to stay!
19394840,472907804,2019-06-20,121147825,Andrea,Nate and Renee were sweet and thoughtful hosts.  The space was private and lovely.  The cats were super friendly and fun.  We also liked the location as it was close to the state parks as well as Portland.  It fit our needs perfectly.
19394840,475183351,2019-06-23,269268476,Emily,The host was super friendly and the space was clean. Being right next to the river was amazing. I would stay here again for sure!

19394840,479386216,2019-06-30,89697046,Bethany,"The accommodation is exactly as advertised. The driveway where you park is steep, but the room is close by. Watch your step - the brick pathway is uneven. Seriously, the creek in back is worth the entire price of admission!!"
19394840,480464244,2019-07-02,70789844,Maria,"This place is a lovely oasis by the river. It’s very private, quiet and cozy. Nate,  Renee and the two kitties gave a warm welcome when I showed up. It’s very easy to find from I-5."

19394840,487171218,2019-07-13,38034586,James,"A nice basement stand-alone unit. Beautiful, waterfront backyard. Convenient location. Unique neighborhood. I'm a cat lover, and I loved that the hosts' two cats came around to visit with us. May not be a good bet if you don't like cats. Something seemed half a beat off in communicating with the hosts."
19394840,488206758,2019-07-14,68147250,Austyn,"The hosts were lovely people and the location was perfect, but we got very little sleep the night we stayed there due to footfalls and squeaky beds. It is a basement room, and when we stayed there the people in the upstairs part of the house were walking around until the early hours of the morning, making it extremely difficult for us all to sleep as the footsteps were extremely loud. Also, one of the beds is a metal frame that is extremely squeaky, so if the person sleeping there moves around in their sleep it will keep the entire room awake. However the cats and the pond out back were nice!"
19394840,488933275,2019-07-15,118838339,Eugene,Great little place and great people. Fun (optional) cats. Great breakfast restaurant a 2 minute walk away.
19394840,493648174,2019-07-22,107481780,Jeff,"The room downstairs and bathroom were clean and good size. What I liked the most in addition to Nate and Renee, they're great, was the pond and flowers and fauna and koi fish and outdoor setting. Loved that the most."
19394840,497661316,2019-07-28,148839818,Christophe,"I stayed at Nate & Renee's a second time this year, and always plan to check on their availability any time I plan to be in Salem.  Their place is a peaceful oasis and they are great hosts."
19394840,498474325,2019-07-29,178338487,Lizz,"One of the most hospitable places I have stayed. Renee came out and meet us when we arrived and showed us her pimped out basement.
Everything is as described, including her very friendly cats: very playful and serene at the same time.
I would like to add, that you might want to let those cats in with you when you are sleeping, otherwise, I recommend a different place. 
The reason being is that I left the cats outside while we were sleeping and one of them was begging to be let in all night. 
It was a great stay nonetheless.
Thank you Renee!"
19394840,499001370,2019-07-30,149098514,Amy,Nicely decorated and comfortable place. Convenient location.  Renee was very kind in helping me with my requests.
19394840,500196555,2019-08-01,277448319,Justin,Great spot!
19394840,500825209,2019-08-02,79099753,Sigal,A beautiful urban retreat. Stunning backyard patio along the water and a magical artsy space inside. The hosts and their cats are incredibly warm and welcoming.
19394840,508334177,2019-08-12,129322258,Cierra,"Renee is a wonderful host, the most considerate & just overall a good person. The space was extremely tidy & adorable, beautiful art everywhere, a peaceful sanctuary with the beautiful outside setup. 10/10 would recommend"
19394840,508965372,2019-08-13,215274023,Tory,Not completely private but in convenient location
19394840,509589356,2019-08-14,244605168,Susan,This is a wonderful place. Very scenic and peaceful. We highly recommend it.
19394840,510209951,2019-08-15,243975551,Marguerite,Nice spot by Mill creek with lovely koi pond and friendly visiting cat (Zeka).
19394840,511754120,2019-08-17,789468,Debbie,The photos don't do this place justice - the garden setting is really really pretty. The cats are super friendly as are their parents. Location is great too - we could've walked to the Capital in 20 min probably. We also appreciated the above average Keurig. Thx Nate & Renee.
19394840,513671616,2019-08-19,36238316,Erin,Nate & Renee's place was very peaceful and relaxing. The artwork and surrounding environment created a serene place to unwind! Thank you both for being such wonderful hosts.
19394840,518527049,2019-08-26,133005887,Restita,"This beautiful space next to a quiet creek was a joy to be in during our stay in Salem. The hosts are very welcoming, friendly and ready to assist. The color scheme of the suite is calming, with beautiful paintings and pictures. The backyard next to the creek is an awesome plus,  which made our morning coffee very enjoyable. Their two cats are very welcoming and friendly, so if you like cats you'll be greeted often.

The next time I'm in Salem for business or workshops, I'll be looking for availability of this suite!"
19394840,520054014,2019-08-29,17393518,Shelley,"If you love cats and a creatively designed space then this is for you. Enjoy the personal touches and the inviting felines, the foliage of the gardens and the close proximity to restaurants and shopping.
Remember to end each day sitting outside and savoring the lush backyard ambience."
19394840,520640663,2019-08-30,283425441,Kyle,Really nice & relaxing home!
19394840,523521319,2019-09-03,105390503,Myranda,Renee and Nate’s place was very clean and very cute. It was exactly as we expected. It was quiet and the backyard was super cool. Renee and Nate were her hospitable and I would definitely stay again. Thank you!!

19394840,524315010,2019-09-05,291481613,Darby,Great place to stay in Salem hosts are super friendly and provide a nice place to stay for a few nights
19394840,525402371,2019-09-07,25889964,Molly,Great stay with Nate and Renee - it's a lovely private downstairs apartment that looks out on a pond and a river. Very relaxing and tranquil. Nate and Renee were great hosts - our only regret was that we didn't get to spend more time with them!
19394840,527812277,2019-09-11,225813145,Nina,The backyard area is the highlight if you want to relax by the creek and the koy pond is cute. Room is spacious with bathroom around the corner. The place is very convenient location in Salem and hosts are eager to help in any way.
19394840,530507023,2019-09-15,69024330,Ernst,Really lovely location by Mill Creek. Yard and patio offer a very nice place to have a quiet moment.
19394840,531096891,2019-09-16,172024289,Lauryn,One of the best places I've ever stayed. A nice little private separate entry room with an amazing view and the best hosts I've ever worked with.
19394840,535098880,2019-09-23,266852735,Lacy,"Nate and Renee are such kind hosts! Usually I am not interested in interacting with hosts, but I am so glad we got to spend time with them! They are amazing people who pointed us in all the right directions during the stay. The room was so comfy and clean, and the decor was intriguing and stylish. The backyard and deck were truly picturesque! I highly recommend staying here!"
19394840,551985500,2019-10-20,78474722,Debra,"Nate and Renee are so responsive when they are needed.  We enjoyed our stay with the very much and we were there a month.  Their location to my work and other things we wanted to do before leaving Salem permanently was so convenient. The price was right too and fit completely within our budget. The great shower/bath products have inspired us to order some of those product lines ourselves. Their friendliness and approachability made our stay so much nicer. If you're looking for an affordable, clean and nice place to stay in Salem, consider Nate and Renee's place."
19394840,552508505,2019-10-21,138433163,Jennifer,"Cozy Oasis with everything you might need. Extra little touches were present in case you forgot something (mini soaps, shampoos, extra toothbrushes, etc). Felt nice and clean. Access to a washer and dryer in case you need it. They have two kitties; didn't get to meet them. Private room has mini-fridge, microwave, sink, bathroom, patio, separate entrance, parking spot, etc."
19394840,553240657,2019-10-23,35167128,Kat,"We really looked forward to staying in Salem and at this Airbnb.  However, when we arrived, the door to the hallway (where the bathroom is located and where there is a washer/dryer for the upstairs residents) was open and the smell of dryer sheets/fragrant cat litter/marijuana was very strong. We closed the door and opened all the windows and left to adventure for the day.  When we came back the dryer sheet/cat litter odor was gone, but strong marijuana smell remained.  The real deal breaker was that the furnace was right outside the door to the bathroom and was so loud, turning on every few minutes, that it made it impossible to stay there.  Not even earplugs would help!  We ended up leaving at 9 pm and going back to Portland.  In addition, the kitchen was dusty and there was actual cat hair and dust in the cups in the cupboard.  We were disappointed and didn't even really get to stay the night due to furnace.   The backyard and pond looked very relaxing and the space looked comfortable enough.  We were looking forward to staying here and so our experience was obviously very disappointed and upsetting."
19394840,556167693,2019-10-28,124852277,Michele,"Lovey, cozy, out of the way but not really, place. Backyard was like a little hideaway.  Close to Willamette University and downtown. Great for a couple, if you like a double bed, or 2 people ( one in the double, and one in the twin daybed).  If you like cats, you will love the resident felines.  If cats bother you, there is the option to have them away from your space. Renee was so warm and welcoming with great local suggestions. A great alternative to the soul-sucking corporate hotels."
19394840,556861927,2019-10-30,18518280,Colleen,"I'm generally a low-key, go with the flow budget traveler, but this place was a big disappointment. It smelled strongly of cats and marijuana, and the bedroom didn't seem like it had been vacuumed or cleaned for a while. When I first arrived, there was a cat locked in the room to greet me (fortunately I like cats, but I imagine most travelers wouldn't be thrilled). The art on the walls (not pictured in the listing) was also overtly erotic to the point that I felt pretty uncomfortable staying there as a single gal. Like another reviewer mentioned, the furnace was really loud, though if that had been the only issue it would have been okay, given the price point.  The kicker came in when I tried to shower in the morning, but the tub had an inch of standing brown water that went down the drain as I flushed the toilet. Gross. I've only ever had positive AirBnB experiences until now, but really wished that I had just sprung for a hotel room this time."
19394840,559785520,2019-11-04,301548643,Judy,Convenient location and hosts are very friendly!
19394840,560761018,2019-11-07,172024289,Lauryn,My favorite place to stay in Salem. Highly recommended. Very thoughtful hosts.
19394840,561544446,2019-11-09,289749529,Amie,A cozy spot to land after plenty of local adventures and day trips!
19394840,563732435,2019-11-13,234797570,Courtney,Nate & Renee’s place was great and we really enjoyed our stay. The bed and the room in general is quite comfy. We appreciated the art hung throughout and    the back yard was lush and peaceful!
19394840,567875865,2019-11-23,19624574,“Skeeter” Carlton,"The back yard view is amazing from the window.  If you do happen to stay here, please try to enjoy the back yard, I wish I’d had the time to of enjoyed it.  The room is very nicely decorated and the bathroom really interesting touches"

19394840,581386271,2019-12-24,314935763,Steven,Great place to stay.  Nate and Renee are very personable and care about their guests.  I initially had some reservations about booking here due to past reviews complaining about different smells (marijuana) but this wasn't a problem for me.  The property was well taken care of and was a great little oasis to escape to.  Would definitely stay here again.
19394840,584853946,2019-12-30,322011277,Nicholas,Super awesome place! Clean chill environment meets all of my need expectations and super awesome people!!!

19394840,593736452,2020-01-16,270638089,Joy,"A cute little renovated basement area, that is good for morning relaxation and a place to crash at night. There aren't a lot of kitchenette items, but right across the street is a great breakfast stop, Sybil's Omelettes! Our host, Nate, was very informative about the area and gave us a lot of space while we stayed for 4 days."
19394840,594470649,2020-01-18,189776758,Frank,"Great place, very cozy and close to downtown.  Nice hosts and a super cool cat!"

19394840,597128952,2020-01-24,24864587,Brenda,"Great stay. Space was clean and big. Renee greeted me and made me feel welcome. There are all sorts of toiletries if you forget something, a mini fridge which was nice to put my leftovers in. Coffee and tea if you're interested. It was quiet and I slept wonderfully. Their two cats were sweet and friendly. I'd definitely stay with Nate and Renee again."
19394840,600449725,2020-02-01,63904582,Andrew,Nice place with an amazing backyard. Great for a quick trip to Salem

19394840,606878545,2020-02-16,77824333,Joe,"A really nice, cozy room with a lovely water view. Close to downtown and fun art all on the walls. Would totally stay again."
19394840,607768224,2020-02-18,56408106,Sally,"My friend and I took a quick trip to Salem to take a class, and have a fun lil getaway in the meantime! Renee greeted us immediately after we used the the key code to get in. She gave us a bottle of wine (how did she know!), and a quick rundown of the gorgeous yard, koi pond, sweet kitties (allergies beware!), and the persnickety plumbing.

After a night out, we returned to have a quiet evening. Unfortunately after flushing the toilet, it immediately began flooding the bathroom from under the seat and sewage proceeded to back up in the tub. The smell was intense, and we called Nate. After suggesting a few fixes, he left work to resolve the issue and assured us that there would be a refund. We went to bed, happy with the comfy bed and couch.

At checkout time (glorious noon!), Renee appeared in the shared laundry area to apologize and promised a $10 refund for the sewage inconvenience. While we appreciated the gesture, it’s been over a week and no refund has happened. We’re super chill renters, so we feel awkward saying anything negative at all- it was just disheartening to have a pretty gross experience and have our hosts not follow through on the smallest offer to make it right. Both hosts were very nice, and we wish that things had been handled better so we wouldn’t feel the need to warn other prospective guests."
19394840,608146776,2020-02-19,13448893,Rosa,"Great location, would stay again!"
19394840,612573228,2020-02-29,16764735,John,Great location and a much bigger room than you think. The two cats are very friendly and the hosts are very respectful of your space.
19394840,613294076,2020-03-01,265854705,Nikolai,Perfect stay with river front property and perfect garden next to the river.

19394840,616111625,2020-03-08,92727880,Brenda,We enjoyed our time along the Mill Stream! The hosts are very welcoming and we enjoyed how quiet and relaxing this place was! Thanks for a great stay and great communication!
19394840,616531166,2020-03-09,62987117,Leanne,"This location is tranquil and quirky. It has a bed, a daybed, and a couch plus your own private bathroom and little kitchenette. You can relax by the creek outside and take in the scenery and wildlife. There are two host, house cats who are very cute and playful but if you have an aversion or an allergy this may not be the spot for you. The space is decorated with the host’s own paintings which adds a nice, personal touch. Overall, a good spot for a one night stay in Salem."
19394840,617047410,2020-03-11,48526102,Rick,Nate and Renee’s place was adorable. Loved waking up to the scenery!
19394840,617362400,2020-03-12,43882931,Tom,It was an easy and peaceful stay. The view from the window out toward the garden and creek was like a calming sanctuary that helped me de-stress after a long work week. The place is exactly as described. The hosts are wonderful and respectful. Quick drive or bike ride to the central downtown but there are plenty dive bars and secret neighborhood food spots near
19394840,619519477,2020-03-17,3372890,Lenelle,"Peaceful ambiance. I woke to squirrels scampering down the tree. Trees, flowers, peace. It here if you desire."
19394840,620889554,2020-03-25,59994,Roy And Cristina,"Nate and Renee’s place is a gem. Even though it’s in the heart of the city, (which provides easy access to all amenities), it is like being out in the country. The room opens to a picture perfect backyard, complete with the Koyie pond and Mill Creek rolling by. We really enjoyed watching the flowing water and friendly ducks that came to visit.

The hosts are friendly and helpful; available at any time to answer questions or requests.

We highly recommend this place and consider yourself lucky if you get to stay here!"
19394840,622034145,2020-04-08,158480315,David,Nate and Renee welcomed us into their home during a time of uncertainty and we appreciate all the hospitality shown to us during our stay.

19394840,634095278,2020-07-02,280256243,Patty,"This space is better than the photos. The beautiful artwork in the room gives a sense of tranquility. The large window looking into the backyard greets you with a koi pond, squirrels, Chipmunks, ducks, Stellar jays, and many more wild life creatures. Many different chairs (including a zero gravity swing) to sit in the garden and enjoy the view. My partner and I just lost our jobs and wanted to reconnect. This space is a lovers sanctuary. It was the fresh space we needed to focus on nature and each other. The hosts are friendly, give great advise, and have created a whimsical and soothing space."

The back yard (right outside   the entry door to the guest suite) is a peaceful oasis with the creek/river right next to the property.  And with Sybil's Omelettes a short walk from the house, wonderful breakfasts are easy to enjoy.  The fridge, microwave, sink and Keurig make the guest suite a home away from home.  The full-size bed, futon and twin bed offer options for sleeping.  Private bath is a plus, too."

Vicky was so considerate to provide essentials and we especially appreciated coffee, milk and eggs so we didn't have to go out immediately after arrival."

It's in a quiet neighborhood with off-street parking, and was a convenient location for us.  Victoria's home is very comfortable and clean and we had everything we needed and then some.  Victoria thankfully provided coffee, milk, fruit and other amenities to see us through until we got to the store.  We would have spent more time in her private backyard if the weather had been warmer.  Maybe next time! I highly recommend her sweet place!"

19840044,179907893,2017-08-08,6546444,Sarah-Ray,This place was so cute. Everything looked like it had just been redone and it felt really clean. My favorite part was probably how comfortable the bed was considering we were mostly there to sleep. There were even chocolates on the pillows when we got there! It was nice there were a few small snacks we could eat in the morning to get us going before we were able to make it out the door for breakfast. Thank you for a peaceful place to relax while in Salem!
19840044,180222728,2017-08-09,64104151,Marcia,"Needing a heatwave break, I booked a place with central air close to home. Wow, what a find! If you are looking for lodging in Salem, you cannot do better than Sunnyslope Retreat. Surprisingly spacious with clean, crisp decor. It was quiet, restful and I loved the private entrance that didn’t require engaging with the homeowners after a tiring day. I travel frequently for work and this place is perfect for business travelers as it made me feel at ease and at home. If the need arises, I will definitely stay here again."

19840044,187859167,2017-08-27,121072775,Judith,"Chuck and Lorie are lovely folks and have a really nice private unit facing the back-yard of their home in Salem.  I was visiting Willamette University where my daughter attends school so it was important to be somewhat close to the capitol area.  Their apartment has a totally private entry (well lit at night) and the apartment is incredibly spacious, consisting of a bedroom, living room and a bath room.  There is an area set aside for preparing food, and a dining table too, all located in the huge living room area.  The apartment is well insulated and during my two night stay,  I heard nary a noise from their house above (where they reside).  The bed was very comfortable with adjustable mattress firming controls and the bedroom is spacious and quiet.  They provided everything you would need if you forgot something (toothpaste, soap, hair products, and even included a number of food items in the kitchen area.  WiFi hook up was effortless and connection speed was fast.  It is conveniently located in a wonderful neighborhood with easy parking I was able to get to Willamette University within 10 minutes of leaving the house.  All in all, it is a wonderful spot in Salem and I will be returning in the future.  Highly recommended!!"
19840044,190624679,2017-09-04,37711090,Joost,Great place which lies in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood of Salem. You have the entire lower floor to yourself which is very spacious.

Chuck was there to meet me for check-in and show me around the place and they were both great with communication during my stay. My favorite part of the house was the fireplace! It kept me warm while winding down my nights. I look forward to a stay again in the future.
19840044,215126585,2017-11-27,26247747,Vivian,"Lorie and Chuck have done a fantastic job of making their apartment cute and comfortable.  The decor is both tasteful and functional, the queen bed and linens are a dream and the written instructions are     
all-encompassing.  With our busy family gathering schedule we had little opportunity to shop so we greatly appreciated the coffee, fruit, yummy snacks and stocked mini fridge.  With a coded private entry door we could come and go at our leisure but our hosts were always available by email and quick to respond to any needs."

Personally very welcoming and then respectful of my privacy. The space was exactly as described with way too many useful and very thoughtful touches and additions to list — a very quiet, welcoming, and immaculately clean home away from home. I will definitely be staying here on my next stop through Salem."

The space was nicely situated in a beautiful backyard garden. Plenty of light and space to spread out.  The apartment was very clean, nicely decorated, with luxurious towels, and good coffee! We enjoyed our stay very much and felt well taken care of by Chuck and Lorie. They even texted to check up on us and ask if there was anything we needed. 
The special touches like the lending library, chocolates and ear plugs on the bedside, and the umbrella by the door were very thoughtful. 

I will definitely stay here again ‘

Chuck and Lorie were the most amazing hosts – they greeted me with a genuine warm welcome, eager to show me around the very comfortable suite in their home. 
Walking around to the private driveway which leads to the separate, well-lit entrance, I walked into a space full of warm tones and beautiful furnishings.
I enjoyed the openness of the room – wide, spacious, comfortable and inviting with many creature comforts to make your stay relaxing and carefree (I especially 
loved the wicker Papsan chair for curling up and reading).  There was a large TV with every channel you could possibly want, a gas fireplace and a buffet set up 
where you can make coffee and snacks or simply enjoy some of the delicious treats that Chuck & Lorie put out to greet you.  
The bathroom is nicely appointed with a large shower and a lot of storage.  
The bedroom was a large space with a very comfortable queen size bed (sleep number!!) and I slept like a baby.
 
I had a wonderful stay in Salem, OR and felt comfortable and well looked after with my hosts Chuck & Lorie @ the Sunnyslope retreat.

19840044,331476263,2018-10-02,216091401,Garry,"Our experience with Chuck and Lorie's AirB&B accommodations was outstanding from our initial contact, to their very prompt replies to all communication, to the warm and inviting arrival, to the tour of the apartment and how everything works all the way through our stay. They checked on us to see if there was anything we needed even though everything was there for us and then some. The attention to details that these lovely people provide make this one of the best places you could choose! If you are looking for spotless accommodations in the area, we highly recommend this gem in south Salem."
19840044,332630193,2018-10-05,58202916,Brenda,"Chuck and Lorie have gone above and beyond to insure their guests’ comfort.  We stayed for three nights and it was just perfect.  Situated in a quiet neighborhood, it is close to everything in Salem.  We really appreciated having separate bedroom and living spaces which felt more like home.  They were great about accommodating our uncertain time of check in."

19840044,337226174,2018-10-15,100598449,Randy,So happy to be back again this year. The apartment is as comfy and sparkling clean as last year. The towels and bedding are luxurious. Looking forward to my next visit!

He showed me everything i needed to know and was very kind.
I would love to stay again if my work brings me back to Salem."
19840044,356571812,2018-12-08,130083237,Joel,"This is my favorite place to stay in Salem (and i've stayed in a few).  I come to Salem 4 or 5 times a year and this is a great place to stay especially if you need to work while you're there.  They have a nice work space setup in the bedroom with plenty of desk space and a comfortable chair.  Plenty of space to relax as well.  Wifi access works well also.  

I'll be back."

They provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! The place is compact and contains everything one needs.

The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace and garden are excellent. Fireplace is beautiful and cozy. Location is incredible, 5 minute walk from stores, bus station, etc... 

They went way beyond to make our long month stay comfortable and memorable.

Thank you very much for hosting us, God bless and wishing you all the best! Anna and Glen"

19840044,460254811,2019-05-28,235789699,Marjorie,"Chuck and Lori seem to have thought of everything we could possibly need;  far beyond anything we anticipated.  A wonderful rest on a Sleep Number bed, a comfy rocker in front of a fire place (gas), plush white towels in the bathroom, a great local Pinot Noir wine waiting with fine cheese  for us after a long day's of travel. Roku movies to entertain us, no- key to- lose coded entry and all very private.  Loved it!!"
19840044,463690790,2019-06-03,57822653,Eric,"Exquisite accomodation  in a serene setting in a peaceful neighborhood. Top of the tier service, cheery setting & decorum , & comfortable furnishings  in a spacious living space with lots of natural light, made for a  sublime experience...and to top off the superlatives...  hosts, Chuck & Lorie, were genuine in their efforts to make me feel welcome in ""Hyatt Regency Club"" member fashion !"
19840044,471618570,2019-06-17,69671433,Evelyn,Great space. Very welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay there. I would recommend it.  We went wine tasting and were able to get there with no trouble.
19840044,477682733,2019-06-28,268136008,Rhonda,My stay was wonderful. The touches that Chuck and Lorie have at their space are so inviting and make the stay so much more appealing than a hotel. I loved having the suggestions for the surrounding area as my son and his family just moved here 6 months ago and still are getting acquainted with the area so we were all able to benefit. Thanks so much for having me. Truly a great first air bnb experience!!
19840044,483743758,2019-07-07,56138237,Diana,One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Chuck and Lorie were extremely thoughtful in what they put into the space. We had everything we needed (and more) for a weekend stay. They were very friendly and accommodating.

They were communicative and friendly, welcoming us to their home (despite our late arrival) and ensuring we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.

19840044,510919773,2019-08-16,118206904,Nathan,"I should say something horrible to hide this GEM!   They elevated the standard to hospitality to an absurd level.   Wine, cheese, yogurt, instructions, guides, personal engagement.  Felt like a lost but returning nephew.   Stay here only if you want all other stays to fall short of your new expectations"
19840044,515273715,2019-08-22,285010158,Kathy,"I was pleasantly surprised by all the little extras and surprises in every corner. Lorie and Chuck made my time away from home feel like home. Loved the pretzels, Chuck!"

19840044,539124057,2019-09-30,85371326,Dede,We had a great stay!  We were in Salem visiting our son who attends Willamette University & stumbled across Chuck & Lorie’s place at the last minute. Very pleased with everything. We were very tired when we first arrived after traveling & were bummed that we didn’t get a chance to pick up a bottle of wine to unwind before we went to bed. We were pleasantly surprised to find wine and snacks greeting us on our arrival.  Really a great place we will be back.
19840044,544685837,2019-10-10,15587980,Jessye,Absolutely loved staying here! Chuck and Lorie are wonderful people. Their space is immaculately clean and the bed is extremely comfortable! Those are our 2 top priorities when staying in an Airbnb and Chuck and Lorie nailed it. We also loved all the extra time and thought they have put into this rental. You can tell they are passionate about hospitality.
19840044,546489937,2019-10-13,121072775,Judith,"Our second stay at Chuck and Lorie's and we were not disappointed.

We enjoy the peace and quiet of the residential location and yet it is very convenient to all of Salem.  The unit is very spacious compared to most airbnbs and we enjoy being able to spread out a bit.  This time we enjoyed the warmth and coziness of the gas fireplace in the evening.  We would definitely stay here again.

Their place is so clean and cozy and the sleep number bed is amazingly comfortable. There is room to stretch out and the fireplace is such a nice treat on a chilly Oregon night.  The neighborhood is  peaceful, quiet, friendly and walkable.  Plus their place is walking distance to groceries and a yummy teriyaki joint!  We will be staying here again!"

However, they do provide a mini fridge, microwave, coffee pot, dishes, and even a crock pot. The bathroom had everything I needed including shampoo, conditioner, and a good blow dryer.  The gas fireplace in the living room was easy to operate and very relaxing in the cool evenings with a book and a glass of wine. (They provide snacks and a lovely bottle of wine.) During the afternoon we were visited by a family of deer, visible through the large picture window in the living room. I appreciated how clean the place was as well as they very detailed and easy to follow instructions for everything.

There are so many thoughtful touches in the home that helped make our stay great. It was fun to pick a few flowers as well. This is a great Airbnb, I highly recommend it!"
19906919,276764277,2018-06-14,74058270,Michele,A lovely home and host!
19906919,285080775,2018-07-02,165412650,Lori,Perfect !!  Is the best way I can described out stay. I had to be in Salem for 2 weeks for work. The house was exceptionally clean and all the extra touches were amazing. 
19906919,294973466,2018-07-22,180470507,Don,A great experience. Very clean and prompt responses from host.
19906919,298741065,2018-07-29,183350810,Joyce,So cute and welcoming.  Everything was so clean and the kitchen was well stocked.  Actually the location was near everything that our family needed.

19906919,311232470,2018-08-20,28885526,Carey,Angela’s place was perfect for our stay. Plenty of space-we didn’t even use the more formal living area. The house has an older cottage feel but with modern amenities. Do take note that there are two sets of stairs-one to two bedrooms on top floor and one to basement entertainment room (where the TV is). Plenty of board games and a few items for the little kiddos downstairs. The kitchen is a bit small if you will have a couple people cooking at one time but great size for one cook. My daughter loved the breakfast nook.
19906919,321175354,2018-09-09,113306371,Rebecca,This place is beautiful and welcoming. And Angela makes sure you have everything you need - going above and beyond!

19906919,331837947,2018-10-03,212136292,Pat,This is an absolutely beautiful home and Angela is wonderful. Hands down the best Airbnb experience you could hope for.
19906919,334336835,2018-10-08,76175710,Joe,"If you are staying in Salem, Angela’s house is the place to go. Brilliant in every way!"
19906919,337299567,2018-10-15,71666441,Jill,The cottage was super lovely and perfect for our needs for the weekend. Angela was super communicative and easy to get ahold of. Would definitely recommend!
19906919,340109234,2018-10-22,41510548,Sara,We absolutely loved staying here! It was perfectly accommodating for our family while visiting family in Salem...really it was sad to leave! We’ll be back for sure!
19906919,345699614,2018-11-05,37005524,Cindy,"Great house in Salem for a family get together! We especially enjoyed the downstairs area. We completed a couple puzzles at the downstairs table while visiting. There are many thoughtful touches - such as Keurig coffee pods in the kitchen, and Alexa for radio and music in the living room. The WiFi worked great too. Very clean and nicely remodeled house!"
19906919,348661931,2018-11-14,31039880,Wanda,"My two co-workers and I stayed at the Jefferson Garden Cottage for 2 nights, as we were in Salem for a work training.  It was perfect!  I think it was actually even better than the pictures portrayed.  The location was just off downtown, in a cute, quiet, older neighborhood with many houses showing signs of renovation.  The cottage was super clean (and I'm super picky!), and contained everything and then some that we might possibly need.  The beds were very comfortable, with nice soft sheets.  The entire interior had been remodeled/renovated with a lovely attention to detail.  And Angela was wonderfully easy to work with.  We would definitely choose the cottage again for our next work or family trip!"
19906919,356285385,2018-12-07,59734379,Rachel,"Stayed at the cottage for a week-long work trip to Salem, OR, and it exceeded my colleague's and my expectations! Was significantly more comfortable than being in a hotel, cozy, warm, and well stocked. We were very happy to stay there!"

19906919,421559262,2019-03-09,76844792,Kristal,"Loved, loved, loved staying in the Jefferson Garden Cottage! The house was spotless and so incredibly comfortable, providing enough space for our family to spread out and enjoy our weeklong stay. The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked with amenities that went above and beyond standard. We watched movies and played games in the family area downstairs, ate our meals around the dining table, and slept soundly in the 3 spacious bedrooms.  My favorite spot was the big green chair by the window in the living room, it was a perfect place to relax, with the fireplace glowing, and either coffee in the morning or wine in the evening. Angela was truly a Superhost, I felt like she was an old friend letting us stay in her home...thank you for going the extra mile!"
19906919,425229623,2019-03-17,9650396,Meredith,"The Jefferson Garden Cottage was the perfect retreat for my family visiting my sister to celebrate her 50th birthday. The house is very nicely decorated, comfortable and exactly as advertised. The back garden had a nice space to relax & the kitchen is also well-appointed. Angela was the perfect host - very responsive & friendly. 

You will definitely enjoy your stay here. It's especially handy for us, being very close to my sister's house (which is too small to accommodate us all visiting), but regardless, I will definitely plan to stay here again!"
19906919,432719228,2019-04-04,219318797,Scott,"The house was amazing and in a very quiet neighborhood. Before you go shopping check the cupboards, they were stocked with just about everything needed for cooking.  It's close to shopping and places to eat."
19906919,438832512,2019-04-17,31039880,Wanda,"The Jefferson Garden Cottage is a lovely home with comfy, warm touches, which was completely remodeled recently, located in a cute, quiet neighborhood of older homes.  It is very clean (and I'm super picky about that!) and beds are comfy.  Kitchen has everything you might need.  This is the second time we've stayed there and will definitely stay again next time we are in Salem."
19906919,445654452,2019-04-29,27612461,Lisa,"Angela's house worked great for me and my two adult children.  The kitchen was well stocked with anything we would need and there were plenty of towels and anything else you could want.  the house was comfortable and Angela was super responsive.  The stairs to the 2nd floor are pretty steep, so be aware if that would be a problem for you.  It's on a nice tree lined street and had a driveway where we could park our car."
19906919,448945041,2019-05-05,243039875,Keith And Sandy,This was a lovely home with everything you could possibly need and more.  We would love to stay here again in the future.  Thank you!!

Thanks to Angela, truly a super host!"
19906919,498982626,2019-07-30,142522671,Jill,"My family really enjoyed our stay here.  It was so spacious and comfortable, with many thoughtful touches and all the amenities you could possibly want or need. My kids especially loved the finished basement and all the toys and art supplies!"

19906919,519012268,2019-08-27,55823405,Burns,"This probably gets said a lot but the pictures do not do justice to this beautiful place. When booking we were not sure if this would be a good location for us due to all of the pre wedding and wedding events taking place(our eldest daughter’s wedding). But we soon learned it was perfect location for us. As far as we were concerned convenient to everything we needed. The place is beautiful inside and out. Everything you need is there. From the kitchen to the bathrooms. I especially loved and enjoyed the lush landscaping and all of the flowers. The way it is laid out it is perfect for a couple or a family. Two couples could easily share and have plenty of privacy. The breakfast nook brought back memories of my grandparent’s house, built at a similar time in Tampa, FL. We all enjoyed using it, even if it meant being a little crowded! 
I believe that you would get the same response from any of the 5 of us, don’t hesitate to stay here!"
19906919,519993889,2019-08-29,39704989,Brian,"The Jefferson Cottage is a darling spacious house.  It looks tiny but is actually 3 stories.  It has everything you need, stocked kitchen if you want to cook in or close to lots of restaurants if you want to eat out.  We could not have been happier!"
19906919,527788339,2019-09-11,174560519,Richard,We highly recommend this house for the location and all the extras supplied. We had plenty of room and it was relaxing after spending each day sightseeing. It is better than a 5 star hotel.
19906919,536419822,2019-09-26,276175392,Cecily,"Angela was a wonderful host. The home was spotless, extremely comfortable, and well-stocked. There were two washers and two dryers, which were really impressive. There were luggage holders and a laundry basket in each room. You can tell a lot of thought went into making this home truly a home away from home. It was beautifully decorated and didn’t seem like you were in someone else’s home. She also had loads of brochures and information about Oregon. Being from Hawaii and new to Oregon, I found that to be really thoughtful and helpful. Angela was quick to answer any questions I had. I will definitely stay here again!"
19906919,546492851,2019-10-13,106152680,Robert,"We were in Salem for family weekend at Willamette University and found Angela's home on Jefferson Street to be incredibly charming and comfortable.

We only regret that we only slept and showered there as our tournament kept us out very late and out early each day. We will keep you place in our favorites 
19906919,599628934,2020-01-30,4721845,Laura Beth,"This house is lovely, so completely quiet and super easy to relax in. Everything is straightforward, clean and taken care of. Angela goes above and beyond what is expected for a host. I usually have ideas for hosts to improve but not in this case! I’ll be back."

19906919,632347539,2020-06-26,107304987,Cindy,"Well appointed, comfortable home with several areas to relax and recharge. Beautiful gardens add to the quite and peaceful atmosphere.

The interior was   well maintained and perfectly clean.   Bedding  was   very  comfortable.  All  bathroom accessories (towels and  toiletries) are of  high  quality.  Kitchen needs are all met.  There  is ample room for communal or  solitary activity.
I  have no reservation  to  giving   a  full recommendation."
19906919,647060037,2020-08-05,62192618,Melanie,"The Jefferson Garden Cottage is a delight to stay in.  Not only is the home warm, welcoming, and fully stocked, the neighborhood is also very convenient to get anywhere in Salem, or surrounding mid-Willamette valley.  If you like the charm of an older home, with the updates of a modern home, this place is for you.  It is a great place to stay with kids as there is a complete basement set up with games, crafts, and movie night, and a nearby baseball field for running around in.  The lovely shaded patio with beautiful garden was great for relaxing."
19906919,649559740,2020-08-10,163812037,Heidi,"My family loved our stay at the Jefferson Cottage.  We enjoyed the homey touches such as soft sheets, towels, etc.  Just what you would have at your own home is here.

Overall a great stay and we look forward to coming back again."

Big driveway to park  on so you don’t have to park in the street. I really enjoyed the patio in the evening. Very quiet neighborhood.
19906919,656448558,2020-08-25,114543290,Austin,We loved our stay here!  We got our daughter settled at WU and it was great to have a clean home to come home to after running around all day.

19906919,672729385,2020-10-09,5371648,Neil,"We had a wonderful week in the cottage.  Super clean, quiet, and comfortable.  While a ""cottage"", we found it spacious and well appointed. Located just north of the state capital, it is a short drive or bike ride to downtown, riverfront, and shopping. Don't miss a walk or bike ride around Minto Island!   

We found Salem a convenient base to explore the Willamette Valley- Eugene, Silver Falls, McMinnville, Cottage Grove, and more.

Angela is a great host- responsive and helpful."

19928942,522194081,2019-09-01,6226741,Tim,Joyce and Bug(her pup) were wonderful hosts. The house was lovely and stylish and very quite. It was the perfect place to rest before heading up to our friend’s wedding at a local vineyard.

19983672,185850926,2017-08-22,143379958,Shari,"We were so fortunate to have booked Megan's home to be in Salem for the great eclipse! She lives in a quiet community and has a very lovely home. Her past experience as the owner of a bed and breakfast is evident in her extraordinary attention to detail, ensuring that her guests are settled in and comfortable. She made sure we had breakfast supplies and snacks, which was so kind of her to do. We were able to watch the eclipse in the meadow like field about 100 yards from her home, and even picked fresh blackberries from the brambles there. Another treat was to sit on her enclosed front patio, enjoying a glass of wine and all the stars above. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat while you explore the Salem area, this is the place to stay."

20035307,184451350,2017-08-19,48989272,Brian,"Wow!  Exceeds expectations!  Feels like a five star retreat!!  Photos do not do it justice.  The room is very spacious, as is the bathroom, and lots of closet room. Recently remodeled: everything new.  And the entire front half of the house is included in the booking: family room, living room.  Private entrance through the front door, bedroom directly to the right.  Only the kitchen/laundry room is ""Shared"" space.  It's in a quiet neighborhood, minutes from downtown/fairgrounds.  
Susan and her pet dog Ari were were great hosts!  Occasionally meeting mornings in the kitchen where she would have a freshly brewed pot of coffee and a wealth of tips for the area.  And her fresh out of the oven blueberry muffins were the best!!
Next time I'm in town, I hope I can stay here again!!"
20035307,185815817,2017-08-22,48989272,Brian,"Susan's place was so nice, I extended the initial stay a few days.  
Her location is great: a couple blocks from the fair grounds. Minutes from downtown and the Capitol.  Couldn't ask for more!
On top of everything, her laundry room was open so I could do a  load while running errands, come back and do another.  This was great as I prepared for the net leg of my travels."
20035307,188551399,2017-08-29,115407374,Callen,"Wonderful host, accurate description, clean, plenty of space, and comfortable!"
20035307,191235441,2017-09-06,148178448,Sarah,Susan is an excellent host. Her place is nice and clean. I had a lovely time sitting a chatting with her.
20035307,194967925,2017-09-17,50207869,Brooke,"Susan's place was absolutely lovely, and she was a fantastic host! The room, bathroom and sitting room were very spacious, wonderfully decorated and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the house is in a quiet neighborhood. Susan went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable -- she let me check in early, greeted me with homemade muffins, and had coffee and breakfast foods available in the fridge. She even helped me get some packages to the post office when I was in a pinch! All in all, a fantastic stay I would highly recommend."
20035307,197521081,2017-09-25,149750057,Eliza,"Susan's house is a wonderful place to stay.  It's clean, has a comfortable bed, large bathroom, close to Willamette University, and a kind hostess!  I highly recommend this place!"
20035307,201645935,2017-10-08,108783798,Steve,Nice location a few miles from downtown and from Willamette University and the state government offices.  Susan was very friendly.  Bath and bed are private and sitting area is nearly private.  Susan is very nice about sharing her kitchen and fridge. Comfortable bed.   We'd stay again!
20035307,203861917,2017-10-15,1169377,Rae,"Susan's place far exceeded my expectations.  I was welcomed at a later hour than planned with a warm, roaring fire and Susan's wonderful hospitality.  The bed was comfortable and private, and the bathroom was much larger than expected, with anything you might need.  I felt at home in the kitchen, where she had coffee and some amazing lemon blueberry muffins (YUM!).  

The neighborhood was adorable - really well kept homes, and completely safe.  She is located five minutes from the freeway and from downtown.  It was really easy to get around. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and wish it could have been longer.  Thank you for being an exceptional hostess!"
20035307,205801725,2017-10-22,147824861,Mckeya,"Staying with Susan was great, I was scared at first as it was out first time using AirBNB. However, the comforting environment and close proximity to all that Salem has to offer simply could not be passed up."
20035307,206723292,2017-10-26,28231331,Derrek,"Simple accommodations, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay in Salem Susan's place keys the bill. Only thing missing is a tv."
20035307,208712429,2017-11-02,152909003,Samantha,"Everything I wanted in my Airbnb. Susan is a perfect hostess. Her home was clean, stylish, and very comfortable."
20035307,210482489,2017-11-09,129659597,Liz,Susan's place is such a great cozy space. All the privacy you need while still having the opportunity to meet and chat if you want. The bathroom is spacious and the bed is super comfy and warm! Susan was a generous and wonderful host and her doggy was such a gentleman. =]
20035307,211439042,2017-11-12,92074789,Alexandra,Susan was so welcoming and provided the perfect space for a relaxing weekend. Her home is very zen. The private bedroom and Susan’s private space are well sound insulated from one another—we were each sure the other party might have heard the other laughing until pretty late but it was not a problem. When we initially arrive Susan shared some fresh beef stew she had just made and every morning there was coffee in the pot. The bed was also super comfortable (has a heated blanket!) with a generous private bathroom. The WiFi is fast and the location is a short drive from Willamette University and down town.
20035307,212033076,2017-11-15,25620333,Phil,Great space and thoughtful host.
20035307,216641180,2017-12-04,101166249,Andrew,"Susan was a very kind host and made sure we had everything we needed for the stay. She was a good conversationalist and very easy to get along with.
Her home is fairly large and we had access to a living room with a fireplace, a bedroom, personal bathroom, and kitchen/dining room.
Susan stayed in the house we occupied, albeit in a different section (demarcated by doors that had “Private” signs on them). Because Susan was so gracious it was not unwelcome; however, if you’re looking for a place where you can have the entire house and its facilities to yourself, this may not be the place for you. Overall, a lovely stay."
20035307,218021901,2017-12-10,150158201,Claudia,"Susan's home is lovely, quiet and comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom are very private and cozy. She is a personable and accommodating person who will join you in conversation or leave you alone, whichever you prefer. Next time I am in Salem I hope I can stay with her."
20035307,220531940,2017-12-22,12383454,Jay,"Very pleasant stay at Susan's place. Her house is super clean, and is tastefully decorated. Though the kitchen is shared, Susan makes the kitchen available to guests almost as if it were their own. I appreciated the short and easy commute to my workplace on State Street, too."
20035307,221204416,2017-12-25,147969786,Kathleen,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience: convenient location,  quiet neighborhood, comfy bed, nicely-equipped kitchen,  simple yet tasteful decor,  and a gracious hostess. If I ever have occasion to need a room in Salem again, this is where I want to be."
20035307,222415784,2017-12-29,79849669,Christina,"Perfect, centrally located home....clean and comfy."
20035307,228625873,2018-01-20,44178482,Minda,"Susan's place is an oasis in the city. Great value -- practically a whole place to yourself (private bedroom, bathroom, living room, dining room, and entrance). Very clean and comfortable. Susan was a wonderful host, good for a conversation, but she was also very respectful of my privacy."
20035307,229469099,2018-01-23,12863036,Chris,Clean well decorated space. Close to downtown Salem. 
20035307,232431358,2018-02-04,117975027,Karen,"Susan is a friendly and generous host, and her little dog is also friendly and exuberant. A great deal of effort clearly went into making the space aesthetically pleasing. It was very clean and nice linens. A nice relaxing living room and dining area. The kitchen is shared, but Susan is very accommodating and makes you feel at ease like you are staying at a relative's home."
20035307,233468597,2018-02-09,165829723,James,I had a great stay here! Close to downtown and restaurants. She was also very accommodating. I recommend staying here!

20035307,246565094,2018-03-25,79849669,Christina,What another delightful stay at this sweet and inviting home.  The kindness the host showed my grandgirls was appreciated...they especially liked the fairy wings and wand! Thank you!!
20035307,248156413,2018-03-30,91405387,Robert And Angela,Susan's place is nestled in a well established neighborhood with mature trees and immaculately kept and maintained homes just minutes from downtown.  On her property were large Tulip Magnolia trees in full bloom making for a fresh spring feel.  We enjoyed staying there and Susan is a wealth of information as far as things to do locally.  We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Salem.
20035307,251299979,2018-04-07,182215150,Nathan,"Susan is amazing! Do not miss this place if you can book it, you'll have an amazing stay and leave with a new friend."
20035307,258819086,2018-04-29,57461059,Janim,"Both Susan and her place were lovely! She made sure we had everything we needed, and made us feel at home. Would definitely stay at her place again."
20035307,260401785,2018-05-04,74058270,Michele,"Great stay. Very clean, stylish, and comfortable place to stay. Very reasonably priced. Susan was a great host. We shared the kitchen, but the beautiful living and dining area was my space. Large bedroom and bathroom. Very comfortable bed. Susan had thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, great coffee, and breakfast items in the fridge. Great neighborhood to walk in. Would highly recommend and plan to stay again."
20035307,262119645,2018-05-07,4147086,Steven,A very good value. Susan is sweet and does her best to be accomodating.
20035307,264794636,2018-05-14,177212295,Rodney,"This is a charming, well-kept, quiet, beautiful place. It is only matched by Susan's care and hospitably. She is ready to chat and just as conscientious to your need for quite. 

A gem in Salem."
20035307,270253574,2018-05-28,70092499,Naveen,"Susan's place is a great one to stay! It is right in the middle of the town in a residential area.  The place was very beautiful and well maintained. We get a private room, living room and the kitchen is shared. The bedroom had heated blankets which was a plus :). 

Susan was a caring and an amazing host, she answered our questions pretty quickly and also ensured there was no problem with us arriving later than the check in time. Our check in was very smooth and she gave a quick tour of the house and left the place to ourselves.  Susan also had breakfast items for us like yogurt, cereals, fruits, juice etc.

We would recommend this place to anyone who want a good place to stay in Salem. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Salem!"
20035307,271955602,2018-06-02,44178482,Minda,"Susan's home is a perfect blend of hospitality and privacy. It is comfortable, clean, and quiet (except for occasional early morning train horns). Good, central location in a residential neighborhood. Walking distance to a park; short drive to downtown. My third time here, and it's always great. REALLY comfy pillows on the bed!"
20035307,275260785,2018-06-10,100933152,Erin,"Susan was super sweet and made us feel so at home. The room was really cute and comfortable. Great location, quite neighborhood but close to the freeway and town."
20035307,276445768,2018-06-13,5026321,David,"Susan’s home was impeccable, and truly elevated my expectations for what an Airbnb should look like. She had snacks, water, and food available, even without advertising. Susan was a delight to chat with in the few moments we crossed paths, and she made my visit to Salem such a delight. Highly recommend her place and a stay with her. "
20035307,277171296,2018-06-15,169245103,Joshua,"I’ve stayed at quite a few Air BnBs and Susan as a host blows everyone out of the water. She is extremely warm, pleasant and friendly. Rooms were extremely clean and smelled amazing. I hope anyone who comes to Salem picks Susan’s humble abode to stay at."
20035307,281444000,2018-06-24,189586191,Jason,She really went above and beyond to make this a welcome place!
20035307,283335243,2018-06-29,181008400,Erin B,"Susan is extremely kind and accommodating. I had to drive to Salem to take a 4-hour test at the major testing center there.  Susan's home is only about 6 minutes away.   She was extremely thoughtful and helpful, and her home is very friendly and quiet. I was able to study and collect my thoughts the day before the exam in a stress-free environment, and I think it made a big difference. Her home was fantastic, and it was really convenient being able to use the kitchen as well. I would absolutely stay here again. Definitely recommend!"
20035307,285450767,2018-07-03,189720594,Kristy,We loved our stay with Susan!
20035307,287125516,2018-07-07,84818663,LeAndre,"This was a great experience. We were very comfortable and happy. Susan was friendly, welcoming and made her home feel like ours. We loved the fresh flowers, comfortable bed and the privacy of our space. It was the little details like juice boxes and extra bathroom toiletries. Susan is a genuinely kind and generous host who treated us like family in her home."
20035307,289196386,2018-07-11,20011163,Erin,"We enjoyed our stay at Susan's while we were visiting family in Stayton. Communication was so easy, and we felt at home instantly. Susan was so friendly and welcoming, and it was nice running into her in the kitchen in the morning. The small touches like flowers and snacks in the fridge were so nice, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with Susan again if we're in the area!"
20035307,292350412,2018-07-17,4732468,Osvaldo,"Susan’s space was amazing it was the perfect place to unwind after a long day non stop day. It was extremely clean and well kept. The small details all around the space really added to the experience. 

Susan had different small amenities available. She had snacks available in case one may need them. She had some basic toiletries available in case I had forgotten something. I had never seen this level of attention from any other Airbnb I had stayed in before!

Overall the place is amazing and you will not regret making this place your stop when in Salem."
20035307,310618076,2018-08-19,191100408,Rita,"Susan is definitely a Superhost! Her place is clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. She is very accommodating and friendly. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again!"
20035307,312124928,2018-08-22,105863522,Deborah,"I L-O-V-E Susan's guest space.  The decor, color and style, suited me perfectly, bringing calm and serenity.  I was pleasantly surprised to have not only private bathroom but also private sitting room.  Loved the quiet and privacy.  Susan was available just behind a door in her private quarters for any questions or for a chat."
20035307,314484956,2018-08-26,1818813,Leanne,"The previous reviews are all very accurate! What a lovely and comfortable home, gracious host, and great location. "
20035307,316679464,2018-08-31,177218482,Rosie,Susan's place is so peaceful and full of positive energy!  She is a total delight.  She went out of her way to find me a few things that I thought I might need and each day there was soothing music playing.  I would absolutely recommend staying here and will so again if the opportunity arises.
20035307,318521760,2018-09-03,92727880,Brenda,Susan was so gracious and welcoming ! We will definitely try to stay with her again in the future. We appreciated the amount of private space we were given and found everything clean and cozy !
20035307,319969515,2018-09-07,212878606,Rives,"Susan is the best.  The house is pretty nice too, but seriously.  Do stay here, and make sure you have a coffee in the morning and chat with Susan a bit.  Ask her about her travels and her work.  You won't regret it.  

And of course as a result of Susan's kindness, her place is well stocked, clean, and wonderful.  She'll make sure you've eaten enough.  Necessities are provided and then some. The house has a good vibe and is very well kept. I have trouble sleeping usually, and I slept like a baby here."
20035307,321172543,2018-09-09,30240385,Larissa,"We were in town for a wedding and found Susan's place. It looked lovely and we had very high expectations for our trip. Even with our expectations Susan went above and beyond and made our trip so easy and delightful! We were driving up from Northern California and due to a fire we were rerouted adding many hours to our trip. This caused us to be arriving close to midnight. Luckily, Susan was so amazing and accommodating and welcomed us warmly in the late hours of the night. To top it all off we had brought our ESA dog with us and were going to leave her with friends or with a sitter for the day we were there but I reached out to Susan and she graciously allowed us to keep our fur baby with us in our room. What could have easily turned into quite a hassle was not a problem at all thanks to Susan's incredible hospitality. If you're in town for any reason I definitely recommend staying with Susan. Not only will she be one of the best hosts, but the space is lovely and she even provided waters and snacks for us in the kitchen. What a great stay we had. Thanks Susan!"
20035307,323495052,2018-09-15,129332830,Justin,"Susan was great, the place was quiet and very clean. I loved the decor and am stealing her interior design ideas for the bathroom. 10/10"
20035307,330666045,2018-09-30,213792307,David,"What a lovely experience we had at this Salem Airbnb! This property was immaculately clean and delightfully, yet simply, decorated and furnished. Extra pillows, blankets, towels, and bathroom amenities were already provided, as were breakfast supplies in the refrigerator and kitchen. The host is gracious and welcoming, yet respects the privacy wishes of her guests. We would stay at this property and recommend it to friends and family in a heartbeat!"
20035307,331828308,2018-10-03,197703079,Douglas,"We stayed with Susan while visiting some friends.  Her home is very lovely, she was a great host.  Comfortable home and nice place to rest for the nights we were in town."
20035307,337231111,2018-10-15,8673572,John,"I can't say enough about Susan and her hospitality. Staying with her felt like staying with family, and I would recommend her to anyone. Susan was more accommodating than even our loftiest expectations and the place itself was immaculate and well stocked with everything a traveler could possibly want. Even her dog, Ari, was a total sweetheart! Would stay again."
20035307,341357735,2018-10-26,13996188,David,"Susan was a very thorough and attentive host, going so far as to offer me train station pick up. The home was very clean and orderly, the room for guests was clearly made into a private space. There is a full bath in the guest room, and guests can have free reign of the rest of the house. The space made me a little worried that my late night going and coming might disturb Susan. I would not recommend this space for folks looking to have a bit more of a carousing adventure in Salem."
20035307,342494543,2018-10-28,40234737,Sherry,"Susan was a super host, her place was quiet & very conveniently located only 1.5 miles from Willamette Univ. where I was visiting my son!"

20035307,348115509,2018-11-12,124425543,Chris,My 2-night stay was great. Susan is a gracious host and offered some wonderful suggestions for places to eat.
20035307,350240979,2018-11-18,188264004,Lauren,"The thing that struck me the most was how everything in the house was part of the overall atmosphere of calmness and serenity. While I was on a trip mostly for business and had little time at the house, I still enjoyed the soothing colors and Asian-influenced decor. The furniture is also simple, but elegant, as well as comfortable. Susan herself was a delightful hostess, whether we were talking about the weather or sharing our stories with each other. I would highly recommend Susan's home for anyone seeking a home to relax in."
20035307,352096395,2018-11-24,17877936,Barbara,"Very clean, quiet, comfy and convenient place to stay.  Easy parking.  Susan is a lovely host. As an older person traveling solo I felt very safe at Susan’s.  So glad I booked it!"
20035307,355367532,2018-12-03,138986778,Pamela,"Susan's description of her space and amenities is accurate.  Found the space inviting, homey and very comfortable (loved reading by the fireplace).  

It's in a quiet neighborhood, that along with a very comfy bed offered a great night's sleep (which is very important to my husband and I). 

Susan was a very thoughtful and personable host, checking in periodically to ensure all was going well with our stay, which was much appreciated.

I was a little anxious about the shared kitchen space (hadn't done this before) and it turned out just fine. Susan gave us fridge space, explained the basics of the kitchen, left us healthy snacks and provided coffee in the morning (all we had to do was push a button). 

I had a workshop in downtown Salem and this was a great location for ease of access, only a couple of miles away (easily walked in decent weather).  

I would recommend Susan's space and would stay there again in a heartbeat."
20035307,355996605,2018-12-06,65387203,Jillian,"Susan was a wonderful host! I arrived pretty late in the evening and she was there waiting to show me all the little tips and tricks to make my stay extra enjoyable. I loved that there was a fireplace and electric blanket, as it was very cold outside when I arrived and I had been in the car much of the day. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and her place was sparkling clean with nice little extra touches for her guests. The neighborhood was quiet and safe with plenty of street parking. I would definitely recommend her place and would stay here again."
20035307,359742163,2018-12-17,5620111,Ardith,"Susan was very welcoming and greeted us when we arrived in Salem. The house is in a cute neighborhood, and it was located very close to where we needed to be all weekend for a wedding. 

The house was cozy, and we appreciated the coffee and snacks available! I also certainly loved the added touch of an electric blanket on the bed.

Overall, we had a good stay and would recommend Susan and her space. Thank you again."

20035307,437553057,2019-04-14,246913907,David,This was my first experience at an Airbnb and Susan did outstanding! I will definitely be coming here whenever I head to Salem. She was very kind well informed of events in the area. And I cannot say enough about her kindness and helpfulness if I could rate her higher I would 10/10!

20035307,466942452,2019-06-09,176559884,Dominick,"We had a wonderful stay in Salem! We felt like the home was very cozy, clean and quiet. You’ll appreciate the tapestry and cultured decorations, hand crafted wooden furniture and the dual blanket warmer in the bed. The home feels newly renovated and the bedroom has a private vibe to it with nice, natural lighting. The quarters included the main living room section of the house, kitchen and bedroom/bathroom which are all spacious. Susan had just the right amount of interaction with a host as we like. We met her upon check in and were provided two keys and a brief set of instructions for around the home. The home is located just a few minutes drive from just about anywhere and Susan even offered to take us a few minutes down the road to a friends wedding we were attending. Super host move :)"

In the evenings we enjoyed reading near the gas fireplace, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was nice. Susan supplied us with a variety of breakfast items to choose from and she was friendly.

The cottage was very private and in a quiet neighborhood.  Just 10 minutes away from downtown Salem.  Parking was easy - right outside the cottage.  Judy had all the amenities of a hotel and more.  I would highly recommend Myrtle Cottage.

Great stay, Judy was ultra fast at responding to messages I sent. We didn’t see them at all during our visit, which we actually prefer, to be honest. Awesome amenities and thoughtful hosts! Two thumbs up!"

20072558,308122875,2018-08-15,204638981,Linda,Myrtle cottage is wonderful.  Peaceful and quiet. Clean and cozy. Perfect for one or two people. Judy is a lovely host and added nice personal touches to the guest house. The cottage is centrally located and easily navigated. The neighborhood is nice and was a great place to take a morning walk before starting your day. Judy thought of everything. I highly recommend staying at Mrytle Cottage.
20072558,323487647,2018-09-15,195078808,Cory,"Unfortunately we did not have a good experience here. We planned to stay for three months, but because of issues with the place that stay had to be cut short. It was much smaller than expected. There was no way to cook at all, which we were led to believe there would be. We even specifically asked the host about that before booking. We had to clean webs off the walls because there were a lot of spiders. We had to kill 4-5 a day. The bed was very loud and squeaks with any movement at all. The shower was nice but it dripped for hours after it was used. If you opened the bathroom door before all the steam cleared out it set the fire alarm off. 

Overall the biggest disappointment was our loss of money after the host didn’t honor our agreement. We had several conversations with the host before paying to come to a fair agreement, as the place didn’t have an honest description of the property. The host was very nice and even understanding, up until it came time to actually make the changes.  Suddenly she starting avoiding us for some reason, which was very frustrating. Unfortunately we were very let down and lost a lot of money because of this. It ended up being ridiculously expensive for what it was, and we would not stay here again."

It's located in a very nice area. Judy provided us with a list of places to eat and to visit and, since we're thinking of moving to the area, the best places to live. We would definitely return. My only caveat would be that it's a fairly large step to get into the tub/shower, which might be of concern to some (it wasn't to us). Highly recommended!"

20072558,613798427,2020-03-02,80208701,Richard,Great little place quiet area except occasional barking dog right next door whose fence was right up to the bedroom window. No real thermostat so the temps can vary quite a bit. Bathroom is very small with limited counter space. Shower is excellent with good pressure but very small and the shower curtain surrounds you and hugs you almost. If grossed out by that you won’t like the shower. It’s quite a climb to get into the tub for the shower and be careful to not touch the metal piping by the hot water as it can be very hot. WiFi is a TMobile Hotspot which was quite slow. Our Verizon phones were faster though the signal weak. Aside from this the place was great value and great attentive host.

20231503,185864082,2017-08-22,95046469,Neel,"Elizabeth is really kind and helpful. My stay at her place was very comfortable. She took every possible effort to make us comfortable. We stayed at her place on eclipse weekend, when everything was booked in advance. She changed our room to accommodate 3 of us comfortably at the last moment, and we appreciated that a lot.  Our original bedroom was smaller to accommodate 3 people, but she made arrangements to accommodate us at such a short notice.
I would definitely like to stay at her place once again. I would recommend her place to Everyone who's willing to spend some time in Salem."

20231503,292339452,2018-07-17,139328462,Matthew,"Elizabeth was a very gracious host. She made sure to meet us in person when we arrived and gave us a tour of our rooms and the premises. She also went out of the way to make sure some undecided family would have a place to stay. Elizabeth made room #2 available to us for booking in addition to room #4 that we had already booked. Even though it was a smaller room, #2 had every thing we needed, every thing that was listed, and even some extras(sewing kit, spare toothbrush, eyeglass repair kit). If you need anything but don't see it(iron and board), just ask and odds are that Elizabeth can make it available. The property is beautiful and shaded and the pool was a welcome relief from the heat. If ever we are in Salem again we will look to book with Elizabeth first. Thank you again Elizabeth!"

As much as my wife and I enjoyed the comfort of an inviting and welcoming home, we were equally impressed with how Elizabeth made sure we had an enjoyable visit. There were wonderful touches that made our overall visit to Salem one to remember!"
20231503,566814826,2019-11-20,9565393,John,"Elizabeth's home is a great place to stay in Salem, and Elizabeth is a fantastic host. Nothing like fresh banana bread waiting in the morning."

20231503,571096020,2019-11-30,49760712,Lucas,Elizabeth's home is beautiful and historic. Can't beat it for a cosy night in a beautiful neighborhood. Also can't beat the hot tub on a cold night!
20231503,573984345,2019-12-07,185540004,John,"Wonderful older, well kept home.  Lots of space.  Everything you need is provided.  Quick response by owner."

20231503,578123266,2019-12-16,95029930,Elena,"Elizabeth's place was very stylish and lifted up our holiday spirits during our CA to WA move before the holidays. We had everything we could imagine to ask for in our room. Lisa met us in person, made sure the hot tub was ready since I was specifically asking if it's still open in December. My husband and I had a very relaxing and luxurious experience our second moving night. For breakfast we had a lot to choose from: yogurt, muffins, coffee & tea, fruits, and oatmeal. So we were able to save some time in the morning and drive long time before stopping for lunch. We also came by a big van, and Elizabeth marked a parking spot for us, and we had no problems fitting in. All our stay we were very warm and safe. When it was time to get back on the road, I met a very friendly black kitty outside that kept purring and asking for pets  If I am ever in Salem, I would love to stay at Elizabeth's place for a longer time--it was amazing."
20231503,579459588,2019-12-20,306624546,Dani,"Luxurious bedding. Elizabeth is super friendly and easy going. Pet friendly. The hot tub made for a relaxing evening and morning. We stayed here while visiting family in the neighborhood. This was the perfect affordable spot, with an amazing king bed! Thank you!!"
20231503,579874208,2019-12-21,28316593,Ashley,"Everything here was PERFECT. Elizabeth is the best host/hostess I have ever had the pleasure of staying with. The home itself is historical and fascinating. The entire day felt like Christmas itself with all of the decorations. I cannot wait to stay in the other rooms and if you get a chance to have her host you, do NOT miss it. She does not disappoint! Just look at her other reviews. I had the best night sleep as well. I could go on and on, but you get the point ;) Looking forward to staying again!"
20231503,582303332,2019-12-26,306624546,Dani,"Our second time staying at Elizabeth’s was just as lovely and inviting as our first time there! The communal spaces felt private and welcoming, and we were always excited to see what the baked good of the day is. We really enjoyed the hot tub both in the evenings and the mornings. The bedding was luxurious and so comfortable. We were able to leave our dogs in the room with no issues, and there was plenty of space to walk the dogs both on the property and in the neighborhood. There is also an amazing dog park just a few minutes drive away- Minto Brown. Elizabeth is super easy going and loving towards our four legged family members. 5 stars, absolutely recommend!"
20231503,582826800,2019-12-27,103385076,Julie,"Very accommodating stay! My only critique is the occasional smell of cat litter. There is a dog, 4 cats, 2 tortoises and an array of poultry but they are kept in separate rooms, however I still was able to smell the animals."
20231503,583402241,2019-12-28,217326201,Iris,"Definitely a nice place to stay, very private and quiet. Super clean and warm. Had all the amenities and if you forgot something, Elizabeth had plenty of toiletries."

The king size bed is super comfortable!  There's a small fridge, micro, coffee maker, plates, glasses...etc....everything has been thought about.

20231503,650240883,2020-08-12,167609398,Julian,"This is truly the best place to stay if you're visiting Salem.

 I came here a little spontaneously but the host, Elizabeth, still went out of her way to accommodate. She set me up in the upstairs room, the bed perfectly made, everything very clean -- and yet not in the cold and sterile way most hotels and AirBnbs prepare their rooms. Instead the room displayed so much warmth and character: antique furniture, travel posters and maps hanging across the walls; all the striking beauty that surrounds, like a landscape of Oregon mountains outside the windows. Plus, I had my own bathroom, thoughtfully fully-stocked with emergency toothpaste, toothbrushes, emergency sanitary pads and so much more. I was impressed by all of this -- so imagine then how I felt when she moved me to the master bedroom. 

Beyond the accommodations, which I will reiterate: acutely prepared for the traveler (coffee-maker, snacks, spare water bottles, etc.) -- I think my time here will be defined as exceptionally inviting as far as AirBnbs, or individuals, go. It is clear that Elizabeth -- hard-working, industrious and ever-considerate throughout my stay -- is a rightful super-host. Because staying here can only be compared to visiting dear friends you haven't seen since forever. Or like an escape to some scenic inn, safe and far-removed from the rowdy world that lies beyond. Or simply like visiting family. I'm so fortunate to have stumbled upon this place."
20231503,657970648,2020-08-29,233758297,Matt,This is by far the best place I've stayed with Air BnB! This is the only place I will stay from now on when traveling to Salem. You are not going to find a better home or a better host!
20231503,658744875,2020-08-30,157909441,Cameron,Welcoming host and cozy room. Elizabeth baked fresh banana bread for us!

We received a welcome message almost immediately, and continued communication until we arrived at 10pm. The house was easy to find (about 4 miles off the 5 Freeway into Salem), ample parking with good lighting, and her home is absolutely beautiful. Letting ourselves in went flawlessly with her precise directions. The room was great; nicely decorated, well stocked, super clean and comfortable! We slept very well. We would definitely recommend staying at Elizabeth’s home!"

20232827,205270565,2017-10-21,141414780,Melanie,"We highly recommend this house and Ligali was an amazing host! He and his family were so helpful, giving local tips and also affording us total privacy. They are really friendly and genuinely kind people. The house was stocked with supplies, everything we needed, including nice appliances- gas stove, a mixer, Keurig, down to the details of tupperware and laundry soap. The deck in the backyard is a peaceful place to sit and relax- with some of those big trees that makes Oregon so nice. The air conditioning was excellent when it was hot. The house is roomy, beds are comfortable, internet fast, and tv nice. The location is nice and it is close to all kinds of stores, the only downside being a little traffic noise. We loved visiting Silver Falls, Lincoln City, Newport, Portland, and Eugene conveniently from Salem. This house was a perfect fit and we felt welcome and at home here. We really appreciated the hospitality and enjoyed our stay."
20232827,208266888,2017-10-31,115597323,Suzanne,"Ligali’s home was exceptionally clean, conveniently located in South Salem (close to my new favorite ice cream shop) and a more comfortable alternative to a local hotel. The home has been remodeled with modern features and has a large backyard and deck. Ligali was very accommodating and was quick to reply via text. I recommend this home for your family."
20232827,209952104,2017-11-06,31968276,Julie,"This is a lovely designed, renovated ranch style home that provides nice sized bedrooms and spacious bathrooms. The laundry area was handy and the kitchen was equipped with top of the line appliances. We missed having some basic condiments, but there was a nice spice rack. Pots and pans are provided, though they are difficult to access in an out of a corner lazy-susan. If you want wine, bring a corkscrew as we weren't able to find one. Keurig coffee pods and creamer was provided and of course appreciated. The mattress, pillows and bedding were delightful...super comfortable and cozy. The street is not super busy but cars did speed along and with the house sitting fairly close to the street, we needed to keep close eye on the two-year old. There was some road noise from the bedrooms but it settled down fairly early each evening."

20232827,214828746,2017-11-26,111326284,Bradley,"Excellent hosts.  Very thoughtful and easy to communicate with.

The house was perfect for our family of 6.  We stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday.  Kitchen was well stocked and had many great appliances pots & pans and utensils.  If you plan to do a lot of cooking as we did, you will need some extra items like cookie sheets, pie plates or baking dishes.

Beds and furniture were all very comfortable.  House was very clean.  Nice Roku TV with lots of streaming channels.

Convenient location close to many stores and restaurants.  

Great place to celebrate the holiday and felt like a home away from home."

20232827,222815518,2017-12-30,22134869,Bernadette,"Ligali's place is EXCELLENT. This is for sure one of my best AirBnB experiences. His place is well-stocked with everything a person could want (coffee, oatmeal, granola bars, ice packs), but still it was clutter-free, spacious, and inviting. We walked up the street late our last night there for some great Thai food. Thank you so much! I hope to stay with you again! :) :)"
20232827,224331982,2018-01-02,62331336,Samantha,We really enjoyed our stay! The house is perfect and everything we hoped it would be and more!!

20232827,230977213,2018-01-29,104266380,Annie,This was the perfect place for my family's stay in Salem. We had everything we needed.  It is located close to everything you need. Would definitely stay here again!  Perfect hosts who responded quickly to our questions!

20232827,242401395,2018-03-11,27075883,Dave,Our family totally loved staying at Ligali's property. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We especially loved the fully equipped kitchen. All the other spaces in the home were also perfect. Ligali was responsive and accommodating. We would love to stay here again on our future trips to Salem and we would highly recommend Ligali's home.
20232827,250594865,2018-04-05,168754844,Michael,"This is THE place for anyone looking for a comfortable, ""like home"" place to stay! Many ammenities included like soap and shampoo, towels, bedding, and even coffee! Spent a week with the family here and could not have asked for anything more! Great house to stay at if visiting Salem!"
20232827,251837483,2018-04-08,89910002,Nick,Perfect place to stay! Very clean. Responsive host. Highly recommended and worth the price.
20232827,262705564,2018-05-09,168793493,Wendy,"It was a very homey place with new renovations but a nice touch of the original house.
It was great for the price when you have a family of six because it came out a lot cheaper then hotel rooms for us & our older married children.
Communication was good but it is a busy street so night time was a little noisey on the weekend but tolerable.
There are a lot of food items there which was nice to have available.
For us the unfortunate part was the previous guest smoked in the house! That was not Ligali's fault and he did let us know before we checked in.  It was airing out when we arrived which helped a lot but every time we closed up and left, it still smelled a little smokey when we got back so we had to air out every time.  If airbnb guests want to smoke than they should look for those units available instead of ruining it for the next guest.  We enjoyed our stay a lot!"
20232827,264786670,2018-05-14,127375081,Linda,This was a spacious home for 6 guests. We enjoyed our stay immensely. It was in a good location for getting to central Salem. The house was appointed with nice things like a Keurig.

20232827,336838387,2018-10-14,71732712,David,I would highly recommend Ligali's AirBnB. The house was clean and very well maintained. Location was quiet. The outdoor area looked very nice. Unfortunately it was a little too cold for us to enjoy it.

20232827,352080427,2018-11-24,7268,Marcy + Niels,"We stayed with my senior dad and our twin one year olds. It's a multigenerational-friendly home. The only steps were at the front door, and it was just a couple. Sensored nightlights in the hall and rooms and few loose items for toddlers to terrorize.

Ligali's place was super clean, spotless and pretty comfortable and uncluttered. Easily accessed without having to communicate with the owner. The home was warned up already when we arrived. It felt thoughtful and like it was arranged for guests instead of feeling like you were staying in someone else's personal home. Quiet at night and squirrels to watch in the backyard.
Two bathrooms and the full kitchen was nice. Once we opened all the curtains and let the daylight in, it felt bigger and even more welcoming."
20232827,357270790,2018-12-09,89910002,Nick,"Really great place to stay: convenient, clean, & quiet! I have stayed in this location multiple times now and will certainly stay again. Very responsive and easy to deal with hosts."

20232827,363865183,2018-12-29,58202916,Brenda,"Our family had a wonderful holiday week at Ligali’s place.  It was every bit as nice in real life as in photos on the internet.  The living areas were spacious and we enjoyed meals around the big dining table and played games and watched TV/movies in the living room.  The kitchen is gorgeously redone and extremely well equipped which was a treat for me so I could cook family holiday meals.  The location is quite nice in South Salem - close to downtown,  groceries, the post office, the bank - everything.  Ligali was very helpful with arrangements and always answered my questions quickly.  The beds were very comfortable with lovely linens.  Having two bathrooms was a big plus for a family gathering.  We hope to stay here again when we visit Salem."

20232827,450564716,2019-05-09,143169792,Kris,"This house was great for us!  Convenient location, quiet neighborhood.  Since a couple of us had bad knees, it was particularly comfortable, since it was all on one floor and the entrance only had a couple of shallow steps.  The kitchen was a delight to use - modern appliances.  The walk-in shower in the utility room was an added bonus!  The main bathroom had plenty of storage for our personal supplies.  The living room was comfortable for us to sit around and talk.  The host was particularly responsive when we had a problem with a kitchen shelf being loose.  I felt it was a comfortable place for a few days.  Since the weather was perfect, we enjoyed sitting on the back deck.  The back yard was private, which was nice."
20232827,452175394,2019-05-12,147109828,Susan,I very clean beautifully furnished home with air conditioning very comfortable beds and very nice amenities.  I highly recommend staying at Ligali's house!

Thoughtful kitchen touches include an electric tea kettle, large toaster, Keurig, coffee pods, tea, hot cocoa, granola bars, fruit chews, full spice rack. There were ice packs in the freezer which we used to pack our picnic. Nest thermostat provided air conditioned comfort and Ring doorbell provided security.

The house was clean,  quiet;  the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with coffee and snacks. Ligali let me know when the cleaners were done so that we could check in before 5 which we appreciated. Several great restaurants are very close by. The Neighborhood was quiet so we all slept well. I would recommend this house and would stay here again."

Situated in a peaceful area, it's  close to shops, restaurants, supermarkets etc. Great size backgarden which we loved for chilling out, plenty of room for the kids to run around and play. Handy with decking area and BBQ. Place was spotless, so clean and the amenities were great!

20232827,652489278,2020-08-16,181435923,Fabiola,"I wasn't happy with this place. When we walked in the house, had an awful smell. We had to drive to the store to buy Febreeze to spray the whole house. I wasn't able to cook, the pans were dirty and smelled bad. The knifes were oxided or dirty. The shower curtain had pink slime. One of the bed covers had a stain.
One of the bathrooms did not have shampoo and conditioner and I had to go out and buy some, which it was another expense.
The TV, wasn’t working properly and the internet kept turning off and on.

Overall, staying at this place caused an extra expense for my family to eat out instead of cooking as I planned to and wasn’t able to due to dirty and smelly pans."

I wish we could have stayed longer! Truly a hidden gem and will be staying again if they will have me! Couldn't have asked for a better home away from home."

20232827,673022491,2020-10-10,365818287,Nicole,This home was immaculate and very family friendly.  We loved being able to visit Silver Falls State Park from here.  We were a little surprised to see that they request shoe not be worn in the house.  This was hard on our feet after hiking most of the day.  You may want to bring a pair of slippers if you're not used to being on hardwood floors all the time.  We loved having a full kitchen and plenty of space for our entire family.

We enjoyed having a lush yard to sit on the patio and relax after attending wedding festivities in Salem. 

The kitchen is a lovely place to gather for family meals. 

Location is very nice, not too far from town, but on a quiet cul de sac. The yard is gorgeous and well cared for. 

We had excellent and timely correspondence with the host. The whole experience was wonderful."

Sheli is quick to respond and so accommodating.  We traveled with a toddler and Sheli offered everything needed, a highchair, play-n-pack, toys, even chubby books! 
I would rebook in a heartbeat without a second thought.  The only disappointment? It was over way to fast!!

This home was immaculate, cozy, and charming...a true ""home away from home"" and I was confident knowing if I did need anything, Jennifer was a phone call away. 

I stayed in the master bedroom and the bed was really comfortable. The eat in kitchen was stocked with all the necessary tools to cook full gourmet meals. There is a downstairs living area with a  large flat-screen TV,  a sectional sofa, and a dining area. 
There is another living space in the front of the home with a love seat and a few comfortable chairs. There is a BBQ/patio and nice backyard... I'm telling you rent this house you will not want to leave!!! 

The location of the home is on a culdesac with a farm behind it, which really added to the charm,  and its only a short few miles from the freeway and downtown. If you are looking for a cozy inviting home look no further... This house is amazing, and Jennifer was a stellar host!"

20332534,581005521,2019-12-23,302204332,Filomena,"The home is bright and lovely. It is very warm and invitingly comfortable. The neighborhood is well maintained and on a hilly drive. The split level has two sets of stairs (about seven steps each), that divide the ground level great room, a second level kitchen/living room, and then a third level where there are three bedrooms two bathrooms (master has a 3/4 bathroom). Persons with mobility constraints will have no access to restrooms in areas  of entertainment since both restrooms are on the third level. Other than the split-level design, the home is perfect for adults with good knees and balance. I do recommend this home to others and would like to return if I need accommodations in Salem in the future."

My husband and I have only stayed in airbnbs that we have had all to ourselves so we were a little skeptical staying here but Daniels place out did itself!

My granddaughter was able to take naps and felt right at home on vacation.   A wonderful inviting home to stay.  Sure beat a hotel room!,!   I would highly recommend their vacation rental."

We had a family of 4 and my son who lost everything in the fire. We could not have asked for more. Thank you so much for your help during our time of need. We felt like gypsies in a caravan with no home. Your welcoming home was better than expected and a much need respite for our family. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for extending your kindness to our nieghbors as well. We will forever be grateful"

20396656,185527842,2017-08-21,38955660,Lee,"Stayed at Jesse's for the Eclipse. He and his partner were awesome! Jesse showed us around all the viewing spots and then took us for beers! They cooked up burgers on the deck and were great hosts.

The park Jesse recommended to see the Eclipse worked out perfect. We had the ideal spot, with a clear view and clear skies!

Thanks for the great trip!"

20463851,612086179,2020-02-28,50242988,Meg,"This was a unique loft space in a great building, and Alex was kind and funny. I think this is a perfect place for the traveler who prefers to be right in the heart of downtown with lots of interesting things to do and restaurants and bars to visit. I wandered into a “paint and sip” at the cider bar downstairs that really made the trip. It was the perfect stay if you prefer something different and like to meet real and interesting people. The space is very cool, clean, and has everything you might need for a short trip. Thanks Alex!"

Would be a great place to hang out, eat, BBQ right on the river. Didn't spend much time in the house (at a training all week), but seemed very cozy."

20769206,311671423,2018-08-21,15107899,Tyler,"Evelyn was just great. She was very accommodating on check in and check out. She would always respond in a timely manner. You have a private room in the basement. Evelyn’s sister also lives in the basement but has her half blocked off and keeps to herself so don’t let that worry you. Evelyn also has some oatmeal packets, Keurig cups for coffee, and tea packets. She has all of the basic ammentities (towels, sheets, soap, shampoo, etc) and even has a small fan and mini space heater. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable place close to town. Thanks again Evelyn!"
20769206,316654378,2018-08-31,198694202,Madeleine,My first experience of Salem was wonderful and very hospitable thanks to Evelyn. I needed a place to stay while my apartment was getting ready and her home was incredibly comfortable.
20769206,324794191,2018-09-17,204330368,Wiliam,Great place to stay for the money. Very friendly host. Very quiet which was great and it was very clean. Great trip.

20769206,336045248,2018-10-13,184021203,Mariann,"I stayed with Evelyn for 2 weeks. She has a lovely home with a beautiful back yard and porch. The room is clean, bed is super comfortable, loved the rocker/ottoman and the amenities like a Kuerig coffee maker, private frig and microwave. Desk and tv in room with Netflix also make for a very pleasant stay. Evelyn is a quiet and very nice lady."
20769206,344505943,2018-11-03,56650358,Martha,This was a quiet and comfortable room to stay in with nice amenities such as a microwave and keurig. The shared bathroom was never an issue and when I needed to use the kitchen it was available. Evelyn was very nice upon meeting and throughout my stay.
20769206,348092832,2018-11-12,66780510,Nicholas,"Evelyn was an accommodating host who stayed up late into the night to receive me after I flew into Portland. Her home is located in a quiet part of town, but it’s also just a few minutes away from downtown, good food and the state Capitol. The bed was comfortable and the room was well kept. If I find myself in Salem again I’ll be staying here again."
20769206,446104201,2019-04-30,111335639,Michelle,"You can expect a quiet, clean space with a gorgeous backyard. The location was absolutely amazing, on a quiet street with an entire walking track located across the street. It was everything I needed."
20769206,511723381,2019-08-17,28563622,Francesco,"Amazing house,beautiful garden and Evelyn is really sweet!Thanks again!"
20769206,559298118,2019-11-03,156217079,Daniel,"This was a stellar place to stay. Evelyn was deeply hospitable and provided a phenomenal place to stay for two months. The room and common area were clean, spacious, and well-supplied. Its proximity to multiple bus routes makes the location ideal for anyone wanting to explore the area, and there's a lot right nearby the house. Evelyn always respected guests' privacy and was always there to provide any information and good conversation. I will greatly miss being there and will be sure to return whenever I revisit the area!"
20769206,562403674,2019-11-10,43136997,Jillian,"Evelyn and her cohost were so sweet. Only saw each of them once or twice during the 5 nights I stayed but they were very prompt to respond to messages if I needed anything. Very comfortable bed with plenty of blankets and pillows. The bathroom is shared but there was only one time it was occupied when I needed it :). I only saw the lady staying in the other room one time while making coffee in the Keurig, and the rooms don’t have shared walls. Excellent value and just what I was looking for. Would definitely stay again if I was in the area."
20769206,576187012,2019-12-12,304884450,Chloe,"Evelyn was so nice and accommodating. The downstairs area is very large and includes a kitchen area, dining area, washer and dryer, and bathroom. My room was great - probably the most comfortable bed that I've ever slept on. I was here for almost two weeks and really enjoyed my stay. Thank you Evelyn!"
20769206,607387263,2020-02-17,71479580,Tommy,"Amazing stay! Very clean space, quiet neighborhood, and very nice hosts! Highly recommend."
20769206,655688753,2020-08-23,360216079,Michael,"I was very fortunate to stumble upon this gem. While we are each unique  in our desires I would happily prefer staying at Evelyn's over the Plaza Hotel or the Breakers in Palm Beach. Why you may ask? Each turn of a towel, folded sheet or fluffed pillow is done with the type of care that only comes with proprietorship. While a rating of AAAAA may ensure it's all booked up and I'll never get to stay again it certainly deserves it. What a treat!"
20843302,203267179,2017-10-14,7411713,Linda,"I highly recommend Don & Karen's home in south east Salem! They have gone more than the extra mile in making sure that their guests are comfortable! 

I spent 3 weeks in their home. My room was very attractive and perfectly appointed with a comfortable bed and pillows, ample closet space, a chest of drawers and a desk which was perfect for my laptop. It also had a comfortable armchairs and plenty of pillows if I wanted to read in bed!  The bathroom was spacious and comfortable with a great shower/tub combo, immediate hot water and plenty of space for my personal items. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook my own meals. There is a Safeway and a Walmart 1/2 miles away. 

Since I didn't have a car, the extra bonus for me was the bus stop for bus line #6 which was  2/10ths of a mile away. I frequently used it to go to my daughter's house.  Of alI the comforts in their home, I wasn't expecting to be so conveniently located to precisely the bus routes I needed to visit my daughter and to go downtown!  Bus line #21 gets you downtown in 20 minutes traveling all along Commercial St which is the main thoroughfare in southeast Salem. That stop is 1/2 a mile away. 

Karen and Don are very thoughtful and ensured I had space in the pantry and a small fridge to store my food items. But best of all was their friendly and warm, easy-going hospitality! I highly recommend staying in their home in southeast Salem!"
20843302,237148557,2018-02-21,144155626,Dami,"Don and Karen are one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. This was my first AirBnB experience and they showed me first class hospitality. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and further helped me out with my accommodation needs. 
Wonderful hosts with a beautiful home that is about 5mins drive to almost everything you’ll need to be comfortable! I’m very happy with my experience. God bless!"
20843302,258215919,2018-04-28,130778708,Shina,"Don and Karen are really nice hosts, great place to stay!"
20843302,293668327,2018-07-20,47028548,Melissa,These guys were really great. Super helpful and friendly. But made sure to give you plenty of space. Very comfortable and clean room and bathroom. Would for sure recommend!
20843302,299315276,2018-07-30,185975934,Susie,Very lovely home and wonderful hospitality.
20843302,323095794,2018-09-14,41396770,Thu,"Don and Karen were the best hosts I could've asked for during my 6 week stay. They were so accommodating with all my requests and made sure all of my questions were answered. The rooms have all you need, the bathroom is spacious, and the house is sparkling clean at all times. The house was always calm and relaxing, easy to come home to after a long day. Their dog is also such a sweetheart on top of it all. They basically became like family at the end of it all! Would definitely recommend anyone coming through Salem to stay here!"
20843302,443318175,2019-04-25,246859923,Rachel,"They’re really great people. They’re friendly, but they also give you space. They have the sweetest dog I have ever met!! They provide so many things, and they really go above and beyond!"
20843302,596101896,2020-01-21,69775262,Colin,"Don and Karen’s home was the perfect place for me to stay while travelling for work. The room was cozy and comfortable, the bathroom was always clean, I had my own fridge, and their dog is the absolute sweetest. They even invited me along to their holiday get togethers when I wasn’t able to travel home to see family."
20843302,620887551,2020-03-25,106394748,Rachel,"I stayed with Don and Karen for 2 months for a physical therapy school clinical rotation. It was a great stay! They were very friendly, hospitable, and welcoming. Their house is in a great location for commuting around the area- close to hikes, parks, local businesses, you name it. They would offer me tips and recommendations for things around the area which was very helpful. I was able to have my own space and be able to visit/interact as well. The house is always very clean and the room is a cool space with a desk for if you need to do work. I would join in on family Catan nights which was always fun. Highly recommend!"
22215712,221758837,2017-12-27,52899211,Duy-Khiem,"First and foremost, Emily and Ian are the nicest couple. They greeted us into their home and made us feel right at home. Not to be overlooked is their wonderfully decorated home with historical, cultural, and fun art pieces throughout; I found myself lost in the some pieces as I admired the artifacts. The accommodation exceeded our expectations in every way. We were only passing by for one night on our way home, but we would have loved to stay longer. Hopefully next time. Thanks for welcoming us into your lovely home and for a wonderful stay."
22215712,222411692,2017-12-29,10061409,Angela,"Emily and Ian were very hospitable hosts, very easy and quick communication and I felt very welcome. The bedroom is very comfortable and the cats are friendly."
22215712,223083948,2017-12-31,18341566,Dainius,We were very happy with our stay! The hosts were friendly and answered our emails quickly.   We slept soundly in the comfortable queen bed.

22215712,308626053,2018-08-16,54284934,Nicole,"I've had a week to think about this review, and I'm still shaken by how I was treated. After checking in and being asked to store my suitcases in the kitchen (because they were too heavy for her new floors), I laid down on the bed to relax. Almost immediately I noticed several ants on the bed. After investigating, I found more ants on the floor, baseboards, walls, and getting into my bag of cookies. When I pointed them out trying to come to a resolution between us, Emily became enraged and said that I should call AirB&B to make other arrangements. As it was my first AirB&B stay, I didn't realize I could do that. She repeatedly yelled about my finding ""one teeny tiny ant"" (there were many ants) and sprayed bug spray around the room while I was in it. And she mentioned that other people had complained about ants and how she doesn't run a professional hotel with an exterminator. Then she told me to take my things and leave. I have never witnessed such behavior in my life, and I was horrified that I was in a strange city with no place to stay. Luckily AirB&B found a lovely place for me to stay less than a mile away and refunded all fees associated with my stay. I really think Emily needs to do more to get rid of the ants, but more importantly, she needs to learn how to keep her cool when things don't go right. I do not recommend her place."
22215712,309156536,2018-08-17,117186777,Jonathan,"Emily and Ian were such kind, warm hosts -- staying here was lovely. Lots of quirky little touches that really brought personality to the home. Everything was clean and neat, I would recommend staying here anytime!"

22215712,317828005,2018-09-02,69419821,Marisa,We had a short and sweet stop at Emily’s house on our way back from a wedding. It was lovely. Emily was very accommodating and the room was perfect for some quick shut eye before hitting the road again. Loved the vintage decor!
22215712,318519230,2018-09-03,38854760,Melanie,"Emily and Ian are great hosts with a fabulous Airbnb setup. The pictures do not do this room justice - it is extremely spacious (as is the bathroom)! I was only in Salem for the one night so I did not use the kitchen, which was available. 

The bedroom and bathroom are all located on the main/first floor; however, there are stairs between the driveway and the front door (which I didn’t mind at all! but may be important to consider depending on a person’s ambulatory needs).

If I’m ever back in Salem, I would definitely see if this location is available again. Highly recommend!"
22215712,319549736,2018-09-06,2994905,Sandra,"Emily, Ian, and Firkin the cat were fantastic hosts! We were so glad to stay there overnight on our long road trip down the 5. The room is super spacious, Firkin the cat and all the animals were a wonderful distraction from the long day, and it was so nice to finish the day in a clean, orderly, and inviting home. I'm sure we would have enjoyed staying longer if we could have. I recommend it for anyone looking for a clean, cozy stay while either exploring the area (just a 10 minutes drive from downtown Salem), or simply stopping by for the night. Thank you for the great stay!"

The room and bathroom were spotless, and we slept great. Be sure to stop by Santiam Brewing if you're staying with them to try some of their amazing variety of beers. And if you are a bird lover, you're in for a special treat!"

22215712,324302364,2018-09-16,52467477,Foogi & Diana,Emily’s place was clean and cozy. We stayed for one night but it felt like home. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area. They have cute cat :)
22215712,325816964,2018-09-20,147748125,Logan,"Great value and comfy room. B sure to remember the host has birds because they start chirping around 10am until 10pm, but otherwise are quiet-  Was a great place to stay overnight!"
22215712,326226081,2018-09-21,213249692,Lesa,Clean room and bathroom in a nice neighborhood!

I was in town for work and it was in a great location for my commute as well as to stores and restaurants. The bed was comfortable and I plan to stay here again if I am back in the area.
22215712,331135291,2018-10-01,71408736,John,Come as a stranger and leaves as a friend. This is the most desirable and authentic experience a traveler could hope for. Emily is a rare diamond among a sea of zirconium. 5 starts.

I had lovely conversations with Emily. I couldn’t have asked for a better spot. I loved all the birds and of course there cat Furkin. I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever in Salem.
22215712,341042864,2018-10-26,61133320,Justin,Had to cancel reservations but went smooth.

22215712,358042412,2018-12-12,227857763,Brad,"Nice hosts in a unique setting.  Hope you like birds, but they are not bothersome at night, at all, and I enjoyed them."
22215712,358259327,2018-12-13,33056813,Austin,Overall wonderful little room. Would recommend it for anyone need a place to stay in Salem for the night

22215712,361497909,2018-12-23,15387785,David,I used Emily's place as a pit stop on my way north. I had a pleasant stay - they have a very nice cat!
22215712,364936563,2018-12-31,226105057,Katie,"We were welcomed in and invited to watch tv with Emily. We were given plenty of privacy and space. While the birds made sure we didn’t sleep in too late, they were charming and never an issue. Great location, friendliness, and a relaxing place after our long excursions."
22215712,368705525,2019-01-07,206666001,Garth,"Ian and Emily are very nice hosts.  I enjoyed my stay at their house.  Very comfortable bed and stylish room.  I very much recommend staying here.  Close to shopping, but in a quite cul de sac."
22215712,400612119,2019-01-12,204623262,Dallas,Emily's was a great host for us. This is our first experience in an Airbnb and she was very lenient with us knowing that (we ended up staying till after 11am cause I didn't understand that there was a check out time). Her house is very unique and comforting and her parrots singing was entertaining. Thank you to Emily and Ian for a great first experience and for being understanding!
22215712,402537986,2019-01-18,4923578,Hannah,"Emily’s place was so lovely - I loved the bird themed decor, and her cat was the sweetest. I came in late and left early in the morning so I didn’t get to spend too much time, but I’d love to in the future."
22215712,402794956,2019-01-19,235497369,Connie,"The host, Emily, couldn't have been nicer, but it didn't make up for the uncomfortable weirdness. When I expressed unease at sleeping just feet from the bloody war print and actual weapons that were attached to the wall (an antique rifle and very sharp-looking spears and knives), Emily moved me to the ""overflow"" room for kids. Neither room had a chair or anyplace to put clothes/suitcase except the scant floorspace, and no hanger for a wet jacket. I asked if it would be alright if I read a book in the vacant family room. She responded that ""Most guests stay in their rooms."" Not so nice, message received! The next morning at 7:45, there was lots of stomping just outside my door (despite the retired couple leaving their shoes by the front door), and one of their 10 cockatoos shrieked loudly for a good while. Again: message received. They needn't have gone to all that trouble; i was already awake and ready to go. Emily had  left a cup and teabag but no provision for coffee.  I took a last look at the still-standing Christmas tree and said goodbye forever to Air B&B."
22215712,403345093,2019-01-20,93024033,Ellie,Cute room and bathroom that were very clean. Easy check-in and perfect place to stop on my road trip! Emily and Ian were quick to respond. Bed was comfy and I enjoyed all the cat and parrot themes around the place. Mahalo nui loa!
22215712,403858483,2019-01-21,237206343,Adam,"Great stay! Clean. quiet, responsive communication. I didn't have time to ask Ian and Emily about some of the interesting artifacts in their home or their experiences in craft beer brewing. Next time..."
22215712,404352336,2019-01-23,111661549,Tanya,This was a nice little place. We really enjoyed our stay.
22215712,406713320,2019-01-30,126701278,Colby,"The place was clean had everything ready when I arrived. I would stay again if in the area. Very nice people and really neat knife, sword and gun on the wall real neat history behind them."
22215712,407327433,2019-02-01,239663108,Bruce,Emily was a considerate host. The property was centrally located too.
22215712,408211095,2019-02-03,17082924,Zoe,"My name is Radha and I am one of three people who were hosted at Emily's home.
These comments only reflect my personal experience, not my friend Zoe who booked the reservation.

Our hosts were very gracious to let us stay even though we booked the wrong date.
They weren't planning on hosting at all that weekend because it was their anniversary
but they let us stay anyway.  Very nice.  Thank you!

I wished I would have read a lot more reviews before we booked it because they
have about 8 tropical birds.  I'm aromatically very sensitive unfortunately, and I would
have chosen differently had I known.  It seems like the hosts would put that more prominently in their profile, since it is such a huge presence in the home.  If you don't like birds in cages and the aromas that go with that, I don't recommend it. 

Also, their profile says you can use the kitchen to prepare food.  All I needed was to
to boil water for my morning cuppa and I mentioned that to Emily during the
tour on arrival. She said that was fine. But at 7am when I was in the kitchen, Emily came out and it felt like I shouldn't be in there. She asked me what I was doing in a sort of uncomfortable way.  Glad I had no need to make food.  I left the kitchen as quickly as I could.  I used my flashlight, since it was still dark out and the birds were asleep, but that woke them and one of them squawked loudly.  

We rented both rooms as there were three of us and the room my friend stayed in
had a lot of ants.  He didn't mention that until after we checked out, so we didn't say
anything to the hosts.

I did read the other reviews, after the fact, and I was taken aback at Emily's unprofessional  responses to her guests, and lack of apology, when given critical feedback.

The bed was comfortable and the price was great!  And the window opens."
22215712,409406842,2019-02-07,240679544,Tiffany,Excellent place to stay at. Emily is very nice and made sure I was comfortable. I stayed at her place for 3 nights and booked another 3 nights in the upcoming month.
22215712,412865520,2019-02-16,53110295,Timothy,"My stay at Emily's place for four nights was lovely. The room is indeed private and tastefully appointment with antique photos and artwork, and artifacts arranged on a wall. The bed is at least a queen and quite comfortable, and there are two end tables with lamps and the overhead light fixture has a Tiffany-esque shade that is lovely. The bathroom is immediately across the hall and fully stocked with soft white towels, and everything is clean. I'd definitely come back and it's a great value. Emily is a great host, but not a talkative one, and I happen to like that."
22215712,414132606,2019-02-18,68267385,Sage,Lovely space nestled in south Salem. Wonderful hosts and a quiet space. Highly recommend.

22215712,420798139,2019-03-07,240679544,Tiffany,Pleasant people and place to stay at. Awesome as always. I will definitely stay again when I am in town

22215712,429697082,2019-03-28,188523334,Lois,"Clean, simple, and too the point. Nothing fancy but convenient for the purpose of my stay."
22215712,431359065,2019-03-31,1103056,Shelly,"If you don't might a truly 'shared' space and birds and a cat, then you might enjoy this.  Owners like to talk and were friendly enough.

For me this was an uncomfortable space, as I like more privacy and a separate entrance.  Very noisy form their TV and talking on the phone, birds very loud, walking through their front door into their small living room felt like we were intruding. Bathroom is shared. Bird cages in kitchen.  Bed in green room very bouncy and you roll to the middle, so not so good for 2 people.  Cat came in our rooms, and there was cat hair on both beds and chairs.   Green room's decorated with weapons and a painting of a battle...a bit uncomfortable."
22215712,432376294,2019-04-03,250121184,Leo,Hidden treasures. Living history.  Lovely parrots

22215712,437559596,2019-04-14,1759097,MaSovaida,"Emily and Ian were such wonderful and gracious hosts! They gave me great recommendations for things to do around the area, and I had a great time chatting with them at their awesome brewery. The room was very peaceful and comfortable, and the cheery bathroom right across the hall was clean with plush towels and extra toiletries. Great value, great people! Thank you, Emily and Ian!"
22215712,438873208,2019-04-17,204763054,Jennifer,"An excellent experience. Hosts were friendly, engaging, and fun. Offered a lovely breakfast on my first day, and shared lovely conversation about books, archery, and history. The cat is adorable and incredibly friendly, and I enjoyed learning about the birds! Absolutely book this space if you are looking for friendly and eccentric conversation!!!"
22215712,442104939,2019-04-22,192181864,Michelle,Fantastic location and neighborhood. Nice sized rooms with a great clean bathroom.

22215712,444296304,2019-04-27,6005158,Brenda,"Emily’s place was comfortable and clean complete with an  amazingly friendly cat! Do be aware that Emily keeps many birds who greet the morning sun with loud enthusiasm. As we had been on the road for two full days, I was awake earlier than I would have wanted. Otherwise, Emily and Ian were kind hosts and made us feel welcome."
22215712,446937119,2019-05-02,14469309,Fitz,Very laid back and accommodating couple.  Dare I say eccentric style but it all worked to a great effect.

22215712,466820586,2019-06-09,127046465,Stefania,"Very uncomfortable mattress. They have a parrot  that woke us up at 6 in the morning, I love animals but the bird started to sing and talk non stop until we checked out, we actually checked out earlier than expected because of that."
22215712,469496896,2019-06-14,226422460,Colin,"Very good communication! No matter what time of day, they always got back to me quickly and on top of that kept me advised"

Her parrots are awesome and the kindest cat we have ever met. Our bedroom was beautifully decorated with everything described. There was also a menu on our bedside table of their owned restaurant. Emily was quick on her toes when we asked questions. Lovely owners, cute pets, and very decorative room. Also allowed us in the kitchen, dining room area where the parrots reside. A bit dirty, but understandable since there were guests (friends) at that moment. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. :)"

22215712,492973129,2019-07-21,271422303,Grace,"Rooms in a private home, Shared bath, it seemed to be a strain to keep up the place. 
Friendly hosts, lots of harmless animals.  Be sure to get a code to re-enter."
22215712,493588426,2019-07-22,260411882,Skylar,Very friendly and accommodating hosts. They allowed me to change a small specification in my reservation last minute and were very understanding. Their animals make you feel like you are at home. I highly enjoyed my stay here.
22215712,495944395,2019-07-26,254458937,Ben,"we enjoyed our stay at the house. the hosts were so hospitable and helpful. the house is inviting and comforting. beautiful decor, and such unique lamps. the back deck is a secluded paradise that is decorated to an immaculate degree"
22215712,496619834,2019-07-27,148880481,Moises,"Emily’s home was breathtaking for us.  The walls are painted vibrant colors and all the decorations were absolutely beautiful.  The back yard is nothing short of a garden you might pay to walk in and relax.  

Emily and her husband were entirely relaxed and hospitable and made us feel comfortable using one of their rooms as well as the common space right away. 

The location is very close to the I-5 so if you are looking for a place to rest this is the ideal spot.   It’s only a shame we didn’t spend more time there."
22215712,498504556,2019-07-29,185388787,Genna,Emily’s place is clean bright cozy and charming. Easy stop off I-5 for a peaceful rest.
22215712,499620320,2019-07-31,199907042,Kris,For $39 a night this place is fine.  I had never stayed in an airbnb before but thought staying in someone's house would be a great way to meet new people. Emily is not the friendliness and I hid out in my room the only night I stayed.  Ended up booking a hotel room for the 2nd night.  I broke the house rule about wearing shoes inside and was headed to my room with supper but was stopped and relegated to the back deck which  no food in the room is also a rule. I take full responsibility that I didn't read the rules close enough.  Emily messaged me from inside while I sat outside letting me know the shoe rule. When I told her i wasn't staying the 2nd night she made sure to let me know that she thought it was awkward that she had to explain the rules.  There are birds in the kitchen so the floor was a mess but I didn't notice the noise much as some had mentioned.  I never did meet the cat.  If you're looking for someplace to sleep and nothing else this place is perfect.  Bathroom is across the hall from the bedroom so it's not possible to completely hide but I tried.
22215712,500154934,2019-08-01,87817287,Kennady,Emily was very hospitable and communicative! We had a great stay and I recommend this place to future guests!
22215712,501565762,2019-08-03,9817749,Elin,"Emily was perfectly nice to us, but we just were uncomfortable with the decor of our rooms, and the general vibes of this place.  The parrots and koi were cool.  Our rooms had very strong primary colors in high-gloss paint, and warlike wall decor; not conducive to good sleep!  We felt uncomfortable and left as soon as possible.  However, different strokes for different folks!  You might like it."
22215712,502390925,2019-08-04,42728142,Mark,"Although I only stayed one night and was not in actually in the house very much, my stay was quite pleasant. My bed was very comfortable, and my bedroom and bath were spotless and charmingly appointed. Emily and Ian were gracious hosts, and we had a fun, all-too-brief chat before I left. This was my first time here, and I definitely plan to stay here the next time I come to Salem."
22215712,504461227,2019-08-07,2839802,Estelle,We are grateful to Ian and Emily for a comfortable and cozy stay. They have a lovely home that is full of character. If Ian is around ask him to show you the coolest bar in Salem :D
22215712,505018842,2019-08-08,48630908,Brenda,"Amazing value. Comfortable,  unique home in nice neighborhood."
22215712,505754077,2019-08-09,74322093,Jo & Allen,"We had a nice little stay at Emily's. She is very sweet and kind. And we were lucky enough to be there on a Thursday night to attend choir practice on the back patio - priceless. Great cat, birds are cool. Great value and location"
22215712,506499028,2019-08-10,6902527,Pascale,"Emily is a generous, kind and gracious host. My daughter and I had a wonderful visit, thank you, Emily! We would gladly stay again."
22215712,508359924,2019-08-12,85071973,Melissa,Emily and Ian have a very comfortable home- Our room & bathroom were really clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed visiting with them a little bit when we arrived in the evening. Their house is in a nice residential area that’s not too far from the 5 freeway. Great stay overall!
22215712,509603429,2019-08-14,78497958,Elizabeth,The neighborhood seems very safe and quiet. The home is not too far from I-5 and close to stores. The hosts are lovely and very interesting and friendly. Their garden is gorgeous and their birds are wonderful company. I would definately stay with them again.
22215712,512966500,2019-08-18,154811794,Patrice,Emily and Ian we're very kind and helpful. We would stay there again.
22215712,515990891,2019-08-23,88176852,Ben,Great hosts. Great decorations. Friendly cat. I was worried when the reviews said there were some birds there and while they can be a little talkative during the day they won't wake you up at night and they're separated pretty far from the rooms. The backyard is beautiful as well.
22215712,517824193,2019-08-25,95857849,Mary,Very clean comfortable room and good location
22215712,530431108,2019-09-15,185841798,Ismael,"Our stay was delightful!  Comfy and relaxing rooms! Emily and  Ian where great host, we would recommend anyone to stay there."

22215712,537509113,2019-09-28,94565859,Olivia,"Emily, Ian and Furkin are the greatest hosts! Furkin is such a celebrity of a cat. Choose this Airbnb to meet the one and only Furkin and stay for the awesome, sweetest hospitality provided by Emily and Ian. Fun decorated space on top of it all too."
22215712,538362154,2019-09-29,278411320,Lisa,Very nice friendly couple. Enjoyed a good nights sleep. Bed was comfortable and private.

22215712,542825333,2019-10-06,20093427,LoboCop,Great place five stars all the way around super friendly and kind.  I would recommend this place
22215712,543878411,2019-10-08,273556738,Nathan,Very clean and comfortable.
22215712,544656249,2019-10-10,111339876,Diane,"Emily and Ian were so kind and friendly. They showed us their animals because we were curious. Emily made us a wonderful breakfast in the morning of bacon, sausage, eggs, and toast. We had great conversation with them. This was a great place to stay! I am also usually allergic to cats, but I wasn’t bothered one bit by their cat."
22215712,545127325,2019-10-11,134602086,David,"Emily and Ian were exceptionally hospitable. Emily served us dinner in the evening when we arrived at their dinner time and then a full breakfast, joining us at the table with her own breakfast. wonderful conversation."
22215712,546479746,2019-10-13,227220874,Bob,"Bed was comfortable, room and bathroom clean.  Communication was great.  If you like beer and good food, go try the Santiam Brewery which they own!  The Shepherd's Pie was super tasty."
22215712,547354969,2019-10-14,141926484,David,Great place! Very friendly
22215712,547695275,2019-10-15,49914,Carolyn,"Oh my goodness this was a fun and unique stay -- I never expected anything like this in Salem! It felt just as much an Airbnb Experience as lodging. Emily and Ian, the cat, and the parrots were all so very welcoming. Based on past reviews, I wore earplugs to bed -- but they were not needed at all. No bird noise until well after breakfast, which was also tasty and filling and not something I usually expect with Airbnb listings these days! The bathroom was spotless, and I enjoyed the colorful and unique decor throughout the house. I wound up staying in the blue/purple room (the other listing) and found the bed to be the right amount of comfort (not too hard, and not one of those too-soft memory foam deals). Definitely recommend this if you're looking for a place with character -- both the home and its occupants!"
22215712,548453976,2019-10-17,1339088,Carol,"Emily’s place was clean, decorated wonderfully, and a nice breakfast was included. She and Ian were fun to talk with. I highly recommend them as hosts!"
22215712,551962678,2019-10-20,275138622,Margaret,"Two bedrooms with shared bath in a clean, friendly environment.  Great location, close to dining opportunities.  Would definitely stay here again!"
22215712,552543616,2019-10-21,1583921,Cordy,"Wonderful hospitality,  magnificent shower, magical gardens....great stay with wonderful host."
22215712,552924428,2019-10-22,302583971,Heather,"The company and conversation was a treat. We connected with Emily over our love for animals, nature and planet protection. And we had the opportunity to see the 'special room'....being British, it was a thumbs up and cheers!"
22215712,554594409,2019-10-26,627214,Andrew,"Emily and Ian are the most thoughtful and generous hosts you will find in Salem. Breakfast was substantial, and very good. Emily introduced us to her gorgeous Sun Conures. Firkin, the extravagantly friendly Tuxedo Cat, introduced himself. The rooms are decorated with warmth and taste. The house is comfortably, not antiseptically, clean. Parking is easy on the cul-de-sac. You will be within minutes of anything you want to do in Salem or Keizer. I recommend without reservation that you make a reservation here."
22215712,555464216,2019-10-27,303987361,Angelika,"Emily's place is a very nice house, it's very clean and very comfortable."
22215712,557325698,2019-10-31,8537382,Gregg,I saw and chatted with Emily a couple times in the morning and she was always very kind and helpful. She was always very eager to make me a breakfast in the morning!
22215712,558212789,2019-11-02,263785574,Wyn,"Emily and Ian welcomed us into not just their home, but also their brewery & restaurant/bar!   We felt part of the family & came away with a full belly after a very comfortable stay... & we’ll return for choir practice!"

22215712,563698999,2019-11-13,58770212,Elizabeth,"I felt very welcomed by Ian and Emily from the time I booked the space.  Lovely accommodations.  I felt very safe, comfy and slept well."

22215712,573000918,2019-12-04,5230863,Mary,Emily and Ian are kind and generous people. Emily offered me homemade bean soup among other goodies when I asked about a nearby restaurant. I left very early in the mornings for meetings and she offered me steaming to go coffee and more treats on my way out the door. Had my own private room and bathroom away from their private upstairs area. Enjoyed meeting her parrots who are serene and shy. Excellent value. Great Airbnb hosts.
22215712,575624881,2019-12-10,157578965,Jay,Great location for I5 travelers.
22215712,579114281,2019-12-19,20535457,Shahidna,Emily’s house is simply unique and beautiful. It feels more like a fancy hotel than an Airbnb. Love it! Her cat is so friendly. Would definitely stay again!
22215712,579461044,2019-12-20,318172557,Arlis,I recommend anyone stay there. Beautiful home and room.

22215712,585358113,2019-12-31,142680279,Kim,Emily&Ian were great hosts. It was very clean and beautifully decorated. It was nice we had our own separate lounge area to watch TV when at their (Website hidden by Airbnb) was so nice we booked 2 more nights with them.

22215712,596727175,2020-01-23,67355571,Tenzin,"Colorful vibrant home with great hosts, very easy to communicate with and quick in response."

22215712,607477482,2020-02-17,150139675,Theresa,A very nice decorated room at a very convenient location.
22215712,610084469,2020-02-23,247652650,Jered,"Tasteful clean bedrooms; comfortable and creatively decorated living room space with ample seating and a large screen TV.  Wifi log-ins are posted in the bedrooms.  The home is on a quiet cul-de-sac about 5 minutes from the freeway in the south part of town.  Winco, Trader Joe's, and several gas stations are just a couple minutes away.  If you're around during the daytime, you'll probably get to meet Roger and Amigo or see the koi in the backyard pond.  Emily and Ian are both quite friendly.  We enjoyed getting to know them a little bit, and yet we still had ample time and space to ourselves."
22215712,611367869,2020-02-26,24864587,Brenda,"I was afraid there would be noise from the parrots and brought earplugs, but really it wasn't a problem. The cat is sweet and doesn't appear that much either. All in all, a quiet and very comfortable space."
22215712,617379822,2020-03-12,59411303,Pam,"Ian and Emily are friendly and gracious hosts.  I was hesitant to stay in an AirBnB that was within the owners' living space, but they made it comfortable and easy.  The very reasonable rules and expectations were clear from the beginning.  The decor was interesting and homey.  I like animals, so it was fun to have the friendly cat around. The parrots were fun to watch and learn about, and they impact the peace and calm of the sleeping quarters at all."
22215712,618854221,2020-03-15,325673984,Kim,Everything was perfect! Their home is spotless and they are great communicators!
22215712,635557705,2020-07-06,13772462,Pam,"Great couple, very sweet. Cute room with my own bathroom across the hall. My 2nd time here. I feel so welcome and comfortable here."
22295718,228443048,2018-01-19,6817128,Allison,"Angela is a very responsive host. Her two bedroom apartment is clean, spacious and very conveniently located downtown. The kitchen is very well stocked if you choose to cook your own food, however, there are several restaurants within a very short walk if you are into that sort of thing. Great place, I'd stay there again for sure."
22295718,237656257,2018-02-23,47386158,Cheryl,I would definitely stay at this apartment again. Angela made check in convenient and easy. The apartment was clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable and we slept great. We enjoyed being downtown and the access to all of the fun restaurants and businesses.

22295718,306551552,2018-08-12,149343338,Josie,Angela’s place is definitely in the heart of Salem. It is very clean and has all the amenities you need to get you through your trip.  It was the perfect place for us as we dropped of our son at college. There are many nearby restaurants and bars in walking distance. Angela is a great host and made sure we had everything we needed to make our trip to Salem the best experience. 
22295718,311671171,2018-08-21,176761933,Irl,A great place.  Highly recommend it to anyone visiting Salem.

I could of snuggled up on that couch the whole stay! An awesome stay, comfortably accomodated 4 adults, would highly recommend!"
22295718,345330499,2018-11-04,215942877,Robert,"I booked the day before, and Angela had no problem with that. The place was clean and ready. This is a great location in Salem with dining options in walking distance and a coffee shop on the corner."

22295718,363010960,2018-12-27,71569027,Misty,"Angela and the condo were both great. Angela communicated everything we needed to check in and we didn't have any issues with finding or accessing the condo. The location was great, the unit was spacious and extremely clean. We had all of the amenities we needed and then some. It was even decorated for the holidays. We will definitely stay here again if it's available the next time we're in town."
22295718,401493877,2019-01-14,7165169,Marshall,"We stayed overnight one night for an event at the Capital--2 adults, 2 children.  Apartment was clean with tons of special touches--heated mattress pads, Keurig with coffee/tea/hot chocolate, Alexa set up for music, easy to use window shades.  Very nicely located in downtown Salem.  It was much better than expected.  Generally quiet, nicely decorated, all the amenities we could ask for.  I wish we had stayed longer."
22295718,404362176,2019-01-23,109713279,Brad,Stayed in Salem for business and Angela’s place met all of our needs
22295718,408227413,2019-02-03,91828597,Terry,"My husband and I stayed in Angela's downtown loft for 5 nights and enjoyed our stay very much! This loft is not a showplace, per se, but it is well organized, clean, comfortable, with plenty of hospitable details and creature comforts provided... Clearly Angela is a professional host; she was extremely responsive and anticipated our every need! 

The apartment's furnishings are comfortable and everything we sought during our stay was provided and easily located. The one bed we slept upon was very comfortable, (the second looked identical), and the shower was super! Parking was nearby--an easy short walk, free, and simple to find. We didn't have an opportunity to utilize the kitchen (beyond the Keurig coffee maker) since we ate every meal at a different local establishment. Among those within easy walking distance, we especially recommend Sweetsmith Desserts and the connected Amadeus Restaurant!  Chira's was excellent as well. Also recommend the coffee at Ike's Box/Issacs, and the cherry cider at 1859 Cider Co in the alley right behind the loft!

The central location of this loft in downtown Salem could not be better situated for shopping, dining, sightseeing, and walking. We loved it and definitely recommend Angela's Downtown Loft! If/when we return to Salem, we will first look for availability at one of Angela's two AirBnB lofts."
22295718,415077505,2019-02-21,15927282,Sybil,"This spot is fantastic - a wonderful and comfortable cheery home in a great location, and Angela was great to work with!!!"
22295718,422279103,2019-03-10,64085376,Samantha,"My friend and I had a great 2 night stay here. The apartment was very clean. The mattresses and pillows were extremely comfortable. For someone wishing to explore the downtown, you cannot beat the location. You’re steps away from great restaurants and entertainment. Angela was a great host. Very easy to communicate with.

There are two bedrooms, one of which has no windows for people who like darkness. It is a very quiet space, stylish, clean, with a very good kitchen. Alexa was a fun treat. We stayed the weekend and ended up making breakfast both days in the fabulous kitchen. And Angela is a dream host. Easy and helpful. She also has best mattresses and towels, and bathroom amenities."

This is a full apartment with everything you need to make your stay comfortable and Angela made it a breeze.  She responded quickly, had my arrival setup perfectly and I always knew she was just a text or call away if I needed her.  This apartment is walking distance to anything you need in the downtown area and very close to the river.  When not in meetings, I enjoyed being able to work “at home”.  I enjoyed my entire stay very much."
22295718,582279383,2019-12-26,4297161,David,"Great and comfortable space in the center of downtown Salem. Spacious, clean, well appointed, and most important comfy beds. Would definitely recommend and will stay there next time I need a space in Salem."

22295718,607368227,2020-02-17,95180585,Bridget,"Overall this was a great stay with thoughtful touches, easy check in, and everything we needed. Unfortunately, an adjoining restaurant decided to do renovation at 11pm on the night of our first day. While this disturbance wasn't the host's fault, I think their handling of the situation fell short of five stars. Hopefully this was a rare occurrence and other guests can just enjoy this nice apartment in a great location."

We have stayed in many places that had only the barest of kitchen equipment and amenities, but this unit was extremely well equipped for cooking in. Parking was also plentiful and easy. We’d stay here again."

23234197,258829475,2018-04-29,72350536,Sunitha,"Nicely maintained space with a roomy living room, a well-appointed kitchen and 2 great bedrooms in a great location. Felt like a home away from home. Highlight was the toy room for my 2yr old. He had a blast with a variety of toys, made it super easy to engage an active toddler! :) The house is kid friendly. They had a booster chair which we could use at dining and the backyard play area was also great. We enjoyed the Keurig coffee and the breakfast items were all well stocked.  The only thing was that we needed a little more room in the closets for our clothes. It was quick & easy communicating with Jason and the instructions were clear. Overall it was a very comfy stay and we will surely consider coming back! :) Thanks."
23234197,261681107,2018-05-06,185775881,Rosemarie,Jason is very responsive and accommodating.  The location is great!

Thank you."

23234197,268344908,2018-05-24,5661620,Hee Eun,Jason’s place was a very comfortable place to stay. We were on our way north and needed somewhere to stay the night. This was so much better than staying a local motel/hotel.  His house was very clean and we really appreciated that there was no shoe wearing in the house. The floors were immaculate. The house was well stocked with all the kitchen amenities we needed and the beds were really great. Got a good sleep for traveling the next day. An added bonus was having chopsticks to use for our meals. Definitely recommended for anyone staying in the area for a longer period or just passing through.
23234197,271594474,2018-06-01,118368780,Louisa,"Jason's house was perfect for our trip to Portland from So. CA. The accommodations were perfect for our family. We relaxed and watched a movie. The laundry room was an added plus. The full kitchen allowed us to prepare are meals. Breakfast was a delight. We went on a day trip the next day to the Benedictine Abbey in Mt. Angel 30 minutes away and Jason was amazing for letting us check out late. I would recommend Jason's home to anyone visiting the Salem, OR area!"
23234197,273900822,2018-06-07,169194038,Hy,"It is a nice and super clean house , you will love it , Jason is a great hoss you will receice his reponding quick."
23234197,278304113,2018-06-17,181296282,Jen,"For my family's stay in OR this house was perfect! The beds were very comfortable, providing restful sleep after long days of hiking. We were able to cook meals, making this a cheaper, more comfortable option than the local hotels.  Jason was always very responsive and accommodating! He has done some nice updating to the house; the layout is great. Having access to the laundry was a big plus. Although, the house is on a semi-busy street the fenced backyard makes for a quiet, private outdoor space. Our little one enjoyed the playroom and the outdoor toys! Overall, wonderful experience if we ever are in Salem, OR again we would consider staying at Jason's again. "
23234197,280250056,2018-06-22,11162497,Robby,"Jason's place is great. Highly recommend it, especially if you have kids."

The house was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, communication was great, the ease of checking in and out was spot on.  It was easy on and off the freeway location was great, restaurant stores less than a half a mile away.  Quiet and safe neighborhood all in all I would absolutely recommend this place and will stay here again."
23234197,293687839,2018-07-20,894656,Lindsay,"This is the owners home or maybe vacation home. It seems as though the family stays elsewhere when the house books. It was slightly new for us having all the family’s belongings out, but it ended up making the stay more comfortable. Great kitchen for cooking, big tv with fast, reliable internet, nice showers with double head and bath with jets, new laundry machines, well stocked with basic foods. On the outskirts of Salem, but not a bad location. Great communication from the host Jason! We would definitely recommend!"
23234197,294200050,2018-07-21,168027992,Steve,Great location and well stocked

An adequate kitchen allowed me to cook all our meals during our stay but I noticed a Shari's restaurant just up the road if the need had arose. ;) All in all a pleasant stay and we would most definitely return. "
23234197,304039013,2018-08-08,205602450,Ben,This house was exactly as described. It was clean and hospitable.  We would definitely rent it again and Jason was a stupendous host. 
23234197,308101037,2018-08-15,19904045,Louis,"This home couldn't have been more perfect for us. Traveling with a 3 year old can be less than fun, but the house was set up for it. An entire playroom full of toys and movies. A kids bed on the floor in the master bedroom. Everything you could think of was there. The house is beautiful and spacious. It's located near lots of restaurants. It was perfect for a trip to Enchanted Forest. Highly recommend!"
23234197,309771267,2018-08-18,104156100,Alexander,"Jason's home was exactly what I needed. clean and he left clear instruction, thank you!

23234197,320343934,2018-09-08,50161508,Usborn,Great place to stay in Salem! They were so generous with their house!
23234197,325070751,2018-09-18,60221890,Dean,"This copy-paste from the host summarizes our experience perfectly:  ""I have to disagree with your assessment of the house. I think our reviews speak to that but you are quite sensitive to certain things that no one has ever mentioned before, so I’ll note those things for future reference. For example, the toys are in the right spot to us and many families who have stayed here - the playroom. No one has ever complained about the vacuum in the dining room (it has to stay on a charger) or flashing lights of the wifi. I suppose the dining room is more of an art and utility space to us so it’s something not noticed by us. Actually I just slid the cabinet over for now to allow extra heating from the vents under the TV but again, I guess others are more sensitive to such aesthetics. Basically the complaints seem a bit harsh from my point of view since we live here, it’s not just a “rental property” but it is what it is. The house has worked out great for all our guests in the past but I’m sorry it didn’t work out for you. Anyway, I’ll issue the refund."""
23234197,327943996,2018-09-24,66627587,Thuy,"Jason's home was just right for us as we were visiting for a wedding and exploring the local area. The home was clean,  and well organized. We made use of the kitchen, laundry, and TV. We appreciated that Jason stocked his kitchen with many conveniences such as breakfast items. We would definitely like to stay at Jason's home next time are in Salem."
23234197,330668325,2018-09-30,45618681,Jordan,"Jason’s home was the perfect home base for our group’s weekend in Salem. Clean, comfortable, and cozy! The continental breakfast and great communication was also very appreciated"

23234197,352121681,2018-11-24,218202715,Gaynor,"Jason's Place was our families first Air B&B and staying there felt as comfortable as being in our own home. The tea, coffee/coffee maker, orange juice and snacks were a wonderful touch! All the items in the kitchen made it easy for us to have several home cooked meals even on Thanksgiving Day.  The location was convenient for us and stores were near if we needed to buy something.  We liked that the home had plenty of room to spread out, two full bathrooms, Wi-Fi, cable TV and lots of seating. Being from Hawaii, we do not worry about cold weather but Jason's Home Instruction Book was helpful to understand not only how to operate the heater but helped give general information about the home. Our family was extremely satisfied with our stay at Jason's Place!"
23234197,408232796,2019-02-03,122075811,Daryl,Jason's place was very clean and well organize.  The house was very  spacious for 3.  The check in process was very simple and easy.  I hadn't spent much time in Jason's home so i could only share what  i could.

23234197,442897963,2019-04-24,247531862,Jill,"Great place to stay if you have young kids. My family of four stayed here for a week - mom, dad, a 3 year old and a 1.5 year old. There are two ridiculously comfortable queen beds (wish the Master was a king though), a toddler bed, and a pack and play! I do wish the rooms had some sort of dresser to put clothes in as the closets are already in use.

Ample, open space with two large bathrooms. My girls loved the toy room, Netflix, and the backyard. We also liked that we could park in the garage. 

Jason was very accommodating and provided a high chair."
23234197,449881114,2019-05-07,5018263,Laura,"Jason’s house was everything we needed for traveling with kids. There were toys, a play house, a swing set, crib, high chair, and so much more that made things easy and fun. The house was clean and well-stocked and the location was within an easy drive of everywhere we wanted to go. I would stay there again and highly recommend this place for families!"

Highly recommend to anyone regardless if you have a family or not."
23234197,491168483,2019-07-19,253957023,Robert,"House was better than expected. Not that we expected anything terrible but photos didn’t do it justice. Nice home, spacious, kid friendly... kids toy room was so entertaining for our children. Coffee maker, pots and pans, washer/dryer all nice amenities! Descent size back yard. Would stay again if in the area! Thanks"

23234197,502466757,2019-08-04,547058,Carla,"Jason’s house was beautiful! I was a little nervous as it was my boyfriend’s first time staying at an Airbnb and he was skeptical and I wanted it to be a good experience for him since I’ve never had a bad Airbnb experience. He was so impressed and pleased! It was comfortable, the temperature was perfect, the beds were comfy, the hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was awesome. 
The house was immaculate! Jason had “continental” type food for us to eat if we wanted and provided delicious coffee for us. I would 100% stay here again and absolutely recommend this home for you. 

Thanks, Jason!"

23234197,539183388,2019-09-30,281922035,Debra,A very nice spacious house with high ceilings.  Jason did a great job in communicating as it was our first time using an Airbnb.  And a great location to the places we needed and wanted to go for dinner etc.  We would definitely check to see if this is available again.
23234197,547721354,2019-10-15,137010914,Liam,"This house is a great place for families or groups of 4-6 people. It's clean and has a well stocked kitchen if you need to cook. Additionally, I made a mistake and booked one less night then I intended to. Jason worked with me to let me book an additional night last minute and I am very grateful for that."
23234197,552872622,2019-10-22,116772053,Kristin,"Jason's place makes traveling with young children a breeze.  From the hours of fun to be had in the playroom and outside play area to the kid-friendly beds and other offered amenities, our whole family was happy and comfortable.  Communication and check in were great, it was very clean and super well stocked, and it is perfectly located for our needs.  We will definitely be back! Thank you Jason!"
23234197,555624292,2019-10-27,233878852,Zuhey,"Spacious place, comfortable beds, and very clean. Also, thank you for letting us use the garage for our van.
We would definitely consider staying here again."
23234197,582861713,2019-12-27,258621649,Ron,"Pleasant home, clean and comfortable beds."
23234197,604878216,2020-02-12,4264131,Aba,"We had a lovely stay at Jason's house with my mother, husband, and infant! The house was exactly as we expected based on the listing and the reviews, and was exactly what we were looking for. We needed a house with a washer/dryer and close to the people we were visiting (speaking of, the playroom was a hit with their 4yo!) Jason was highly responsive before and during our stay, and we also really appreciated the very clear instructions and guidelines in the binder. Would definitely stay here again!"
23234197,645956888,2020-08-02,73120527,Jamie,"Our stay went well. There was coffee and tea and the beds were comfortable. There was plenty of towels and the washer and dryer worked well. Nice sized Tv and good yard space. Someone came to mow the yard while we were there which was nice nice we stayed 2 months. Jason was quick to respond to questions when asked. Overall, we were pleased with our stay."
23234197,655640870,2020-08-23,73894129,David,"I loved staying at this house. When we go back to Salem we will look at staying there again. 
     First of all, the location is great! You are only about 5 minutes to I5 and even less to markets and restaurants. We found a new breakfast place that you have to try. It is called Toast and Jam. Breakfast was great (try the coffee cake on the side), dinner was so so.
     Jason was a good host. Great communication of what to expect and what they expect from us (not much).  
     The amenities were great because they offered the use of their washer and dryer which made life so much easier. Not a small w/d but a full size great SamSung w/d. Even better than what I have at home. They also provided the detergent. They also had more than adequate soap at all the sinks and TP and paper towels. I really felt at home and liked that I didn't have to go to the store to get any supplies that I would only use very little of. Seems like someone lives in the house and left it for me to use as I need.
     If you have little ones, they have some play things and books that would make it easy for your kids to spend some time enjoying. 
    Only 4th AirBnB experience, but best so far by far.
Thanks Jason!"

24155499,277586941,2018-06-16,153695306,Treva,The best! Incomparable to any other Airbnb.
24155499,278298736,2018-06-17,123683121,Wendy,"I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ENOUGH!!!!!!! Lisa is the BOMB! I want my future house to look just like her AirBnB!!!! This is hands down the BEST AirBnB I have ever been to! The AirBnB's I have been to after Lisa's have just been disappointment after disappointment. The studio is located in a nicely lighted alleyway behind the house. Lisa has kindly turned on the lantern for you to find your way to her specific gate if you happen to check in at night. There is parking inside the gate, making it extra safe! You will ooh and ahh when you first step in. This place was SPOTLESS!!! I could not find any dust or bugs! Lisa left lovely handwritten notes throughout the studio to help guide you into a comfortable stay! SPACE: SO pretty. I love the white wooden floors, the decor, all the thoughtful details, the garden, the windows, the curtains, EVERYTHING! The room was so beautiful in the morning with the sunlight streaming through the windows and birds chirping in the background. The room was nicely air conditioned too! BED""ROOM"": Super comfortable and clean! Lisa provided earplugs, earmask, and charger! There was even a vase of fresh flowers from her own backyard! There were also interesting books by the nightstand about various topics from art to the universe! ART TABLE: Hands down one of the best things in the studio! No TV? No problems! Channel your creativity on the art table! Lisa has thought of EVERYTHING! All types of paper were provided, from watercolor to acrylic. She had brushes, oils, oil pastels, crayons, color pencils, watercolors, etc. Even a jar of water was placed on the table for watercolor! I LOVE IT HERE! We made lots of art on this table. LIVING ""ROOM"": The sofa was super comfortable and Lisa has even placed a blanket on there! The coffee table was super sleek and the rug was oh so soft. There were travel books (around Oregon and everywhere else!) provided as well as a clipboard of to-go menus from various restaurants around the town and Lisa's handwritten notes of recs! KITCHEN: OH MY GOODNESS!!! A fridge full of items (homemade apricot preserves, jam, cream cheese, bagels, orange juice, various carbonated drinks, wine, hard boiled eggs (!!!), apples, yogurt (!!!), lots of tea options, coffee, hot chocolate. Microwave. There was also a cart of microwaveable breakfast items (oatmeal, popcorn, etc.) The kitchen sink was HUGE! Pots, pans, cups, plates, tea set, knives, utensils, sandwich bags, saran wrap, dishwashing soap, drying rack, etc. were ALL provided. Lisa even thoughtfully left out a plate of homemade confetti cookies with a handwritten note welcoming us! P.S. - they were DELICIOUS! BATHROOM: This looked so sleek!!! I love the oriental decor theme! Lisa provided handmade bubble baths. The toilet was super comfortable and the sink and bathtub looked really modern. There was even a medicinal cabinet with ibuprofen, cotton swabs, shaver / shaving creams / hair sprays, toothbrushes, etc. The shampoo, conditioner,..."
24155499,283850301,2018-06-30,14658569,Matt,"Lisa prepared for our stay with so many thoughtful touches. From the fresh baked cookies to the toys and books for our 2 year old, Lisa was on point. She provided some small noshing items (eggs, bagels, soda water) for us after our weary travels. It felt like we were staying at a friends house. 

Speaking of the space, it was immaculate. The bed was comfy, if a little firm (the wife likes a firm bed and I prefer a softer touch; constant battle in the house) for me. The large tub next to the window gave all of us a relaxing soak at the end of our day. When you stay at Lisa's, plan on taking a bath, it's totally worth it (not to mention a little tough, not impossible, to shower). One other point of note, there were two frosted glass skylights in the  bed/living room that allowed in a decent amount of natural light. The ambiance of the light was appreciated, except when we had to put the daughter to bed (we stayed in the middle of summer, so it was light until after 9pm). Not even close enough to take a star, just want people to know (yeah right, like anyone besides Lisa has made it this far!) the scoop. I was lucky enough to spend an hour in the back yard at dusk on a comfortable love seat-thingy, got to see a beautiful sunset. 

Check-in/check-out was a breeze. 

All-in-all, one of the best stays we have had at a bnb (and not just of the air variety). Lisa is a pro!"
24155499,285460836,2018-07-03,65091759,Alexa,This quaint spot is perfect for your stay in Salem. Very relaxing and welcoming. Lisa has added tons of extra thoughtful touches and the space is perfect for a getaway.
24155499,289573713,2018-07-12,158710262,Mary Beth,5 stars for Lisa's airbnb!  I highly recommend this airbnb to anyone traveling to Salem.  It is centrally located and a quick drive for a day of wine tasting in Willamette.  All of the little touches made us feel like we were in a 5 star spa (loved the bubble bath options!)  Definitely book this for your next visit to Salem.
24155499,290088641,2018-07-13,49365071,Nicole,"Wow! What an absolutely beautiful space! It was clean, stylish, and cozy. The perfect place for my son and I to rest and rejuvenate on our road trip. Lisa communicated quickly and easily, and we were welcomed with chocolate chip cookies and a hand written note. The fridge was stocked with breakfast items and there was a full kitchen available to us. I was able to take a lovely bath in the huge tub with delightful, homemade bath oil. The bed was super comfortable and there was a large table with art supplies for us to use. I can’t say enough good things about this awesome place. Thank you, Lisa! We hope to come back again!"

This place would be a perfect fiscally-responsible romantic getaway, an ideal location for writers/artists/creatives to get inspired... or a comfortable respite on a business or school trip! "
24155499,294212276,2018-07-21,38027708,Kim,"Lisa’s place was a fantastic home away from home. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay the night in Salem. Her place was really clean and beautiful. She added so many little touches like art supplies to encourage creativity, the bubble bath in the bathroom to accompany the awesome tub and the drinks and food in the kitchen. Oh, and I can’t forget the yummy plate of chocolate chip cookies welcoming me. I enjoyed her place and if I’m ever back in Salem I’d stay here again for sure!"
24155499,295028799,2018-07-22,21179479,Bailey,What a beautiful little spot! All kinds of sweet little touches added to make you feel at home! She has a lovely art station set up. My best friend and I only stayed one night and were in town for a wedding so we didn’t have very much time to spend enjoying all the beautiful art and scenery. I will definitely stay again!

Both beds were comfortable. She added unique touches including suggestions for restaurants, scented bubble bath oils, items to use to create art, food in the fridge and even homemade chocolate chip cookies! We didn’t want to leave! We got to meet Lisa in person. She is so kind and genuine. I am so happy I got to stay here! "
24155499,298830875,2018-07-29,60367170,Patrick,"I dont even know how to properly describe our visit to Lisa's guest house. the property is amazing, everything so clean. subtle things like snacks left out and breakfast in the fridge ready to prepare. she was amazing with our kids and her dog (who may wonder into the guest house) is an absolute gem. our kids wanted to take Lady home with us. this is an absolute gem of an Airbnb. do not hesitate to stay."
24155499,299381574,2018-07-30,63858529,Christopher,Honestly so much has been written I have little to add.  I would only say that this place totally raised the 5 star bar going forward and if Airbnb gives out awards this place should receive one.

We didn’t even have to go out for breakfast because she had arranged all kinds of fresh food for us to enjoy! We definitly recommend staying here."

24155499,330668949,2018-09-30,49300519,Margo,Such a wonderful place to stay.  When I travel the 2 most important things for places where I stay are that they are quiet and clean.  Lisa's place was definitely both of those and much more.  The place was spacious and had everything we needed including a great variety of breakfast foods in the refrigerator and some delicious home-made cookies sitting on the counter when we arrived.  There was a lot of information on area attractions and restaurants on the coffee table.  The place is conveniently located with many restaurants less than 2 miles away.  I definitely recommend this place.
24155499,332170194,2018-10-04,218451481,Cindy,"This cozy studio and yard is an inviting, creative and peaceful place to unwind.  Just a few minutes from I-5 but tucked back in a nice, quaint neighborhood with a park close by.  Lisa has done a great job of adding spa-like touches: fresh flowers on the nightstand, essential oils to use in the sunken tub and luxurious towels, yummy ""welcome"" cookies and a great variety of options for breakfast.  I felt comfortable and relaxed, from the quick response to my initial reservation to the moment I closed the door to leave.  Well done, Lisa!"
24155499,333077627,2018-10-06,66409803,Jennifer,I’ve stayed here before and once again found it to be calming and quiet after a heavy long day of grad school classes.  As could be expected Lisa ensured a personal welcome with a plate of gluten/dairy free goodies (we’d conversed about dietary choice before) and a sweet note wishing me well. Couldn’t ask for a better experience and place to call home for a night!
24155499,333857611,2018-10-07,7292177,Puneet,Excellent apartment! Highly recommend it. Felt like home - thanks to the special-touches and arrangements by Lisa.

24155499,337598837,2018-10-16,10683669,Lexi,"One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. It’s not overly fancy or huge but impeccably clean, many thoughtful and personal touches and an AMAZING bathtub. She provides plenty of unexpected amenities and even homemade goodies. I would absolutely stay here again - highly recommend!"

24155499,338516183,2018-10-19,69046096,Lauren,"Lisa’s place was so lovely. We’d been hiking in Crater Lake all day and were exhausted when we got in. Her place was perfect and restful. She thought of every detail - bubble bath, notes with directions on how to turn on the AC, creamer for the coffee, even eye masks to help us sleep better! Even though our stay was short, it was great. Would definitely recommend!"
24155499,338890033,2018-10-20,40910235,Ally,"We loved Lisa’s space. It’s obvious she has put a lot of time and energy into making it such a thoughtful, welcoming place to stay. We don’t travel to Salem often, but if we do again you can bet I’ll be staying here!"
24155499,339591387,2018-10-21,19657383,Jeromy,"I have stayed in Air BnBs all over the world and I have never stayed in a more thoughtful place as this. Every corner was stuffed with hospitality. A creative art space, an array of bubble bath, fresh cut flowers, and a fridge full of amenities  made this a dream of a stay. Someone got their PhD from HGTV and I definitely took some notes to add to my own living space. If you’re ever in Salem make sure to seek refuge in this little piece of heaven."
24155499,340690440,2018-10-24,70818262,Alicia,Lovely house and kind host!
24155499,341364927,2018-10-26,15602101,James,Great space.  Very comfortable and private.  Lisa was very generous and had a great breakfast lined up for us.  There is a nice artistic feel to the space with plenty of supplies to pass some time with.
24155499,408847390,2019-02-05,152384618,Byron,"I was fortunate to be able to spend a month in Lisa's cottage during the winter of 2019.  Lisa has created a wonderful space, and is a warm, caring, attentive, and responsive host.  She has an artist's eye, and it shows in the attention to detail and the feeling of quality and style in the cottage.  I hope I am lucky enough to stay at Lisa's cottage again in the future!"
24155499,409098398,2019-02-06,1917015,Devon,"This place is just as wonderful as the previous reviews indicate. After spending 12 hours outside setting up for an event, I returned here to find homemade cookies and a wonderful tub for a nice soak! There were so many small touches exceeded all expectation. If I am ever in Salem overnight again I will definitely want to stay here!"
24155499,412103730,2019-02-14,39366977,Scott,"Lisa’s place was very cute, clean, comfortable, and well stocked with breakfast items, bathroom supplies, and other thoughtful amenities. We would definitely stay here again."

The bed is comfy, the soaking tub was great, and breakfast in the morning was fantastic. Highly recommend for a relaxing getaway!"
24155499,413661935,2019-02-17,64549799,Joel,This cottage was a wonderful place to stay. Definitely one of the cutest places we have stayed. The location is great and we loved the amenities. We definitely recommend staying here if you are in the Salem area.
24155499,414142931,2019-02-18,70819686,Kat,"Wow - this place is amazing!!  It was easy to find the place and check in.  The decor was very nice.  There were cute little signs here and there in the house which were really helpful with things like checking out, adjusting the temperature, and more.  The bathroom was awesome - like a spa! There was no traditional shower but there was a huge bathtub with bubble bath options and a shower head.  I appreciated the toiletries available like lotion, band-aids, and make-up remover wipes.  We were blown away by the kitchen - there were breakfast items and many drink options.  I had a lovely cup of tea in a fancy teacup before bed.  It was so nice to grab breakfast in the morning there instead of having to go out somewhere.  The yard was really nice and had a pretty sitting area (although it was too cold for us to use it this time).  We couldn't get connected to the internet, but Lisa responded to our message as soon as she saw it and helped with the router.  All in all, this was the nicest little Airbnb and we definitely want to come back to Salem just to stay here again!!"
24155499,415439330,2019-02-22,23299692,Sara,"Wow. Lisa's place was fantastic if you are like me and looking for a relaxing place to stay!

24155499,416587880,2019-02-24,225489961,Liam,"Lisa has one of the best places I have ever stayed at. She goes beyond any other host to make your stay more enjoyable by providing eggs in the fridge, fresh cookies on the counter, and bagels for breakfast. The interior of the place is beautifully designed, with a spacious layout and beautiful design. Lisa has also filled the place with books on art and Oregon, as well as provided guests with an art table that goes beyond expectation. I would recommend this place to anyone, and I really wish we could have stayed longer."

My daughter enjoyed the art supplies she thoufgtfully left for visitors, and I was particularly surprised and grateful for the extra pack of cookies for our return trip (and her shared recipe)."

24155499,435859391,2019-04-11,13539972,Monica,What a perfect space for my stay in Salem. I was in town to visit Willamette University. The location was very convenient for exploring the school as well as the downtown. I especially loved the art supplies ♥️♥️

24155499,442921065,2019-04-24,2784195,Kathy,"My teenage son and I stayed st Lisa’s place while visiting Willamette University. The place is lovely, purposefully decorated, super clean, and quiet with windows looking out at the garden and lots of welcoming touches (fresh cookies awaiting us, breakfast options, bubble bath choices, etc.) I took advantage of the art supplies which offered a great break in the middle of touring 7 colleges in 6 days. I don’t think the kid will apply to Willamette but I’d love another excuse to get back to Lisa’s place! Nicest AirBNB I’ve stayed in."
24155499,443337755,2019-04-25,10361920,Claire,"We loved the place! It was very tastefully decorated, the giant bathtub and art table being our favorite things. Big bed was comfy, pull out bed was new which was nice for the kids. The sun hit the porch and I basked on it while the kids played in the yard.

Maybe I'll think of a reason to go back to Salem, just to stay there. :) She was incredibly helpful with suggestions for restaurants, and very quick to respond to my questions. The guest house was immaculate, and was very peaceful and relaxing. The thoughtful touches were intentional (cookies, bubble bath, covers for the skylights, helpful notes, just to name a few) and made us feel well cared for. It was a lovely trip! Thank you Lisa!"
24155499,449540929,2019-05-06,166276834,Karen,"Wow! Where do I start?  Lisa is an amazing host.  We were greeted with beautiful cut flowers from her garden and chocolate chip cookies.  

   The refrigerator was filled with all kinds of goodies and she provided an oatmeal bar and other goodies as well.  There was a french press for delicious Peets coffee, a great variety of teas and lemon infused water.

   The space is spacious and comfortable.  There is only a tub with a shower wand, but it suit us well.  The medicine cabinet had all kinds of items, in case we forgot anything from home.  She even provided a variety of bubble bath options.  The bed was very comfortable, which is a biggie for me.  I slept much better in a strange place than I normally do.

   This is a ""don't miss"" place.  The garden is beautiful and there is even a place to lounge if you aren't as busy as we were.  I would stay here again in a flat second."

24155499,456158855,2019-05-20,33894631,James,Sweet place. Excellent location. Lisa set it up so beautifully. The garden with birds chirping outside made for a very restful stay. ✨
24155499,456518932,2019-05-21,32966664,Jake,Great location and Lisa’s amenities and notes around the studio were great touches.
24155499,456896101,2019-05-22,26006184,Lisl,"One the nicest places we’ve stayed! Lisa has thought of everything to make her guests feel comfortable and welcomed,
from fresh flowers to art
supplies. The space was beautifully decorated and immaculate. We hope to visit again someday!"
24155499,457718539,2019-05-24,173842857,Em,10/10 - definitely stay here if you're needing accommodation in Salem!! Lovely space & the bath was amazing after a long day in Silver Falls State Park.
24155499,459803128,2019-05-27,214994789,Magnolia,"This place ticks all the boxes. Above all, Lisa is the quintessential Airbnb host. She took the time to answer all our questions promptly and made us feel at home in her elegantly designed, very clean and well priced cottage. We look forward to returning! Highly recommended."
24155499,461568901,2019-05-31,106052509,Erika,"It was awesome!  Great quick breakfast options and many suggestions for local meals.  Very clean and comfortable; easy check-in/check-out.  My friend saw the place when I drove us both back to pick up something before dinner, she was very disappointed in her hotel afterward."
24155499,462103617,2019-06-01,128678726,Hunter,"This is the best Airbnb I've ever stayed. Lisa are so thoughtful that she provided us literally everything that we possibly could need. The bagels, coffee, and wine are so delicious. Everything was so perfect. Will definitely come back again!"
24155499,463086305,2019-06-02,1971733,Caroline,"This was our first visit to Salem, and staying in Lisa's cottage gave us a very fine impression indeed!  We had a great and comfortable time there, and Lisa was a great hostess.  Her space is so nicely designed, with everything we needed, including a very comfortable bed and a great kitchen and bathroom, plus all of the things she left for us: great coffee, wine, eggs, bagels, chocolates, jams, and nice suggestions for places to go.  We went to the Salem Ale Works for a good beer and dinner, which was nice (there are a few other breweries nearby) and though we wanted to go to the Little Canoli Bakery for pastries the next morning, it was closed on Sunday so we went to Lisa's favorite cafe downtown called Archives, a really nice choice.  Her home is located near an incredible park of 100 year old white oak and that fit in nicely with the book I'm reading, called The Overstory.  In any case, we'd be happy to return without a doubt...Thank you, Lisa!"
24155499,464060737,2019-06-04,108161167,Tim,Quiet neighborhood. Beautiful garden and lawn. Elegant in doors. Loved the beverage and light breakfast options from the refrigerator. We enjoyed it all!
24155499,465416237,2019-06-07,145736351,Taylor,"We absolutely cannot express how wonderful staying at Lisa’s place is. This is our second time staying with her and we have loved staying every time. If you love baths, you are in for a treat! Her home is so bright, relaxing, open, and rejuvenating. If you need to do work, she has a great table for great light for doing work! I can’t find a flaw in this place!"
24155499,468138012,2019-06-11,55052629,Julie,The space was airy and wonderful. We rented it for our in-laws who are well traveled to stay near us as our house is small. They ADORED the space. It was spotlessly clean and had a number of comfortable amenities in a quiet neighborhood! Perfect hospitality and space.
24155499,468957914,2019-06-13,62460739,Andrea,"When staying in Salem, this is the place to stay!  The space is large, bright and has so many amenities that you will want to stay longer.  It is within 15 - 20 minutes of several excellent wineries and the beautiful countryside.  Lisa knows how to add just the right touches to make the stay an awesome experience!"
24155499,470037632,2019-06-15,232033599,Edith,Amazing!!! The nicest Airbnb I've ever stayed at!
24155499,474096079,2019-06-22,112236065,John And Lisa,Lisa’s place was perfect for my husband and I and our daughter who is nine years old. It was the perfect size. It is super clean and cozy. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring her garden as well as lounging in the yard.
24155499,475042556,2019-06-23,239858451,Joel,"An awesome place to stay! Lisa is a great host, and we felt very comfortable and welcome!"
24155499,475687888,2019-06-24,213612454,Jared,"Such a wonderful place! Lisa stocks the fridge with breakfast foods, the bathroom has an awesome bathtub to relax in, paint and art supplies for the guest to use. The neighborhood is great for walks. Highly recommend this listing."
24155499,476234040,2019-06-25,128165693,Marcia,"Lisa’s place is amazing. It’s a lovely studio apartment. 
The decor is clean and stylish. We have stayed at many Airbnb’s and this is one of the best. Lisa had so many little extras - bagels, cream cheese, wine, half and half, eggs (raw and hard boiled), yogurt and more in the fridge; several possible needed items in the medicine cabinet; oatmeal and toppings, coffee and teas; art supplies to play with; lovely garden and yard; local area info; and more. We will be back!"
24155499,476650614,2019-06-26,268379154,Brent,"Stay was on point, had all the amenities and there were no unexpected items lacking (stayed at a place with no 3-pronged outlets on this trip as well for example). Lisa had little touches everywhere that made the stay comfortable and even left little tips around so you didn't have to figure out how to use anything."
24155499,477109908,2019-06-27,128927742,Jasmine,"Honestly, we would live at Lisa’s place if possible! Haha :) The interior design is so beautiful and the bed is extremely comfortable. We didn’t get to enjoy the art supplies provided but found it very thoughtful. Clear instructions are given to get to the home & it was easy to follow. If we didn’t have leftovers from the night before, we would’ve definitely had some of the snacks/food that was provided. We hope to be back at some point with the opportunity to stay longer. We didn’t get to meet Lisa but she responded quickly to us and seemed very sweet. Book here, you’ll enjoy it as much as we did. Thank you Lisa!"
24155499,477664425,2019-06-28,74314668,Keren,BEST Airbnb I have ever stayed at and I've stayed at a lot in the last few years. AMAZING!!!!!
24155499,478231712,2019-06-29,46020386,Esther,"Wow, Lisa’s place was the cutest and her attention to detail was so thoughtful. From the bathtub, chocolates, and painting supplies, how could I have wanted more? But there was more. Thank you for the wonderful stay! :)"
24155499,479321514,2019-06-30,256745114,Kyle,So clean and cozy! Highly recommend.
24155499,480465321,2019-07-02,22007864,Lauren,This was our second stay and Lisa’s place is one of the best Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at. She provides so many extra amenities and thoughtful touches. There are even art supplies if you feel so moved! So cozy and well decorated. We love staying here and will be back! Oh and don’t miss the beautiful park with the tall trees right nearby!
24155499,480882025,2019-07-03,134619677,Jd,"I have booked quite a bit room through Airbnb and it is the best one I have met, Lisa is a great host, considerate with great hospitality, and my son love the yard very much. Thanks Lisa for making the accommodation becoming part of my happy travel."
24155499,481405484,2019-07-04,23259287,Tanya,"Lisa was the best host that I have ever had using Airbnb. The place was not only cute, but also very well organized and homey. She was so kind to have left us some breakfast goodies. We enjoyed our stay very much and can’t wait for the next visit."
24155499,488188438,2019-07-14,57060079,Shannon,"Wow. Just wow. 
The most beautifully well thought out airbnb I have stayed at in some time. 
Every detail thought out perfectly and the most comfortable bed to date! 
A sweet city to explore as well. Thank you so much for having us. We can’t recommend this place enough. Still blown away!"
24155499,488933326,2019-07-15,226832148,Love,Excellent stay. Lisa has thought of everything with her many tips and small details. Thank you for a pleasant experience.

24155499,490538235,2019-07-18,217453901,Stacie Kiyomi,"Clean, stylish and cozy. I really can’t say enough nice things about the thoughtful instructions and amenities: Lisa left 3 labeled bubble bath bottles in the bathroom and bagels as well as hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator!! The bed was very comfortable (felt like a memory foam mattress) and the neighborhood is safe and beautifully residential. Lisa was also very responsive to our texts and questions. Superhost indeed!"
24155499,491165061,2019-07-19,45850611,Larysa,"This place is incredible. Sparkling clean, relaxing, with thoughtful touches and creative space. I loved it."
24155499,492971497,2019-07-21,200874930,Christopher,"The space was very clean and homey! 
The bed was fantastic and the deep tub provided us with relaxation after a long day of sightseeing. Great location within 10 minutes of downtown Salem. We would definitely recommend!"
24155499,493648577,2019-07-22,257081158,Harley,"This was only our second time using the Airbnb. Lisa was absolutely amazing. She was hospitable and very welcoming all while respecting our privacy in every way. We enjoyed staying here very much. We would definitely stay again if we come back to Salem. We drew an octopus in the bathtub, look for it if you stay lol. 

P.s. the little tips written down were a huge help and super cute. 

We have never stayed anywhere else that was so comfortable like staying in our own home!"
24155499,497748027,2019-07-28,105978953,Jessica,"Goes above and beyond all expectations. Decent area, quaint, beautiful and thoughtful touches. Everything we needed and more."
24155499,498502897,2019-07-29,167644941,James,"Very nice place, centrally located. We walked into a fully air-conditioned room and lots of personal notes about everything in the place, Even had bagels and Nutella, some nice jams. Some hard boiled eggs were made as well."

24155499,502517593,2019-08-04,130848426,Kathleen,"Lovely,  lovely, lovely is what i have to say about Lisa's place. She clearly wants to make her guests comfortable and she lives up to the superhost designation.  There were many special touches from fresh flowers, wine on hand, high quality linens, art supplies and bath products. We hope to stay here next year for the same annual event we attend. Thank you Lisa"
24155499,505083259,2019-08-08,259567698,Angela,This cottage is centrally located near downtown Salem but on a quiet residential street. The unit is private super clean and chocked full of amenities. The refrig had everything we needed for 4 days of breakfast. loved it!
24155499,506507911,2019-08-10,60031085,Suzann,"The accommodations were perfect for my sister and I. Very clean, quiet  and cozy! The bathroom was spa like. She had bagels, oatmeal and yogurt available for us. Very nice!"
24155499,507690562,2019-08-11,130182713,Candace,"Lisa was excellent at responding quickly and was very helpful at accommodating early check in once the previous guests checked out. The studio was clean and adorable with little notes throughout to help feel at home in the studio, including a personalized note at check-in. Would absolutely stay here again. Great experience!"

24155499,509608137,2019-08-14,1450490,Adam,"Outstanding place! If you need some peace and quiet, this is perfect."
24155499,510226239,2019-08-15,92810609,Carly,"I stayed at this spot one night on a work trip. It felt PERFECT for me! Between fresh garden flowers, snacks/drinks, big tub, art area, comfy bed, and being super clean...i felt so relaxed and at-ease. I wish I had a longer work trip!"
24155499,511689848,2019-08-17,16604167,Blandine,It was an amazing stay at Lise Home. All was really perfect! Thank you so much for all you made for us. We love American People ♥️♥️♥️ and your hospitality !
24155499,514197558,2019-08-20,91506966,Ian,A gem in Salem! Zen-like private apartment in a quiet neighborhood just minutes from downtown and Willamette University. Sparkling clean and comfortable. Great value. I would return!
24155499,515334731,2019-08-22,91506966,Ian,"A piece of heaven in Salem! Quiet, private, sparkling clean, and in a great location. Just minutes to downtown Salem and Willamette. Very zen feel to the place which was super nice. I would return here for sure!"

24155499,517796780,2019-08-25,74897458,Jen,"Absolutely charming home -- we were in love! The entire space was whatever comes after sparkling clean, and there were thoughtful touches sprinkled around. If I had to choose one word to describe the home, I would call it a ""retreat"". The location calls you to relax from the moment you set foot in the door. There is an art table with all sorts of supplies, fresh flowers, treats like bagels, chocolates + a welcome note, a wonderfully deep bathtub with scented bubble bath ... I could go on and on. The home is bright and airy, and the furnishings are welcoming and current. The photos are a perfect representation of the location -- it really is that cute and that comfortable. We were in Salem to enjoy a concert at the Elsinore Theatre and it took less than 10 minutes to reach our destination. Wholeheartedly recommend. If we're ever back in Salem, we will most certainly check to see if this location is available, because we would be thrilled to visit again."
24155499,521304585,2019-08-31,286535170,Megan,Wonderfullly inspiring and peacful space. I thoroughly enjoyed.

24155499,524858859,2019-09-06,76849158,Raj,"AMAZING!! Perfect place to stay for any type of person. The neighborhood is beautiful, the garden is wonderful, and the bathtub is even better. No TV, which was amazing, because it made me not want to dull my brain with television. The arts and crafts is by far the best part. I painted like 5 different things and I was only there a couple of nights, sucgh a good vibe. I would recommend this play to everyone, Lisa is amazing too."
24155499,526430940,2019-09-08,100980584,Michael,Lisa’s place was sparkling neat and beautiful. notes throughout the house made it even easier. Would definitely be back!!!

24155499,528810949,2019-09-13,102529553,Jody,"My daughter and her wife spent an evening here right before heading on deployment.  It couldn’t have been more perfect.  I took some things over before they arrived and the personal touches from Lisa brought me to tears.  Lisa responds quickly to questions.   If you have a reason to stay in Salem,  please reserve this cottage.  You will not be disappointed."
24155499,529337879,2019-09-14,75049642,Jessica,"Airbnbs are ruined for me forever.  This was the perfect space, and I do not mention that lightly."

24155499,537453756,2019-09-28,189524091,Ashley,"One of the best places I’ve stayed. Super clean, huge garden tub, art table, and tons of perfect little touches. We especially loved the view of the garden, the spa bubble bath and shampoos, fresh flowers, and everything we could ever want for breakfast. Thanks, Lisa, for being an amazing host!"
24155499,539603366,2019-10-01,66594476,Shirley,I really loved this space.  So many special touches. Would love to stay there again at some time.

24155499,546652729,2019-10-13,21410145,Brian,"This is a wonderful place to stay with extra and thoughtful touches.  Wonderful full tub, stocked fridge, super comfy bed, and even art supplies for tapping into your creative side.  Access is fabulous and affords you great parking and entry into your room without any need to interact with the main house.  We LOVED staying here."
24155499,547274349,2019-10-14,66121022,Kristin,"Lisa’s cute cottage getaway was the perfect way for me to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend. It was such a cute and quaint little spot and once you opened the door the beautiful little touches she had were perfect and really made you feel at home. From the handwritten note welcoming us to her place to the selections of bath bubbles with you could use in the oversized tub that you were able to see the stars if using at night. The cottage felt so homey with the relaxing color palettes to the selections of furniture and decor. It really made me feel at home, even more so being an artist as well as she and having an array of art supplies you could dabble with in your spare time.  She left some snacks in the fridge and so many directions on how to use and works things around the cottage so you could figure it out fast and really relax. She was so fast at responding which was nice in a host knowing if you did need help she would be there. We would definitely stay with her again as we loved her place!"
24155499,550468217,2019-10-18,19713340,Rachel,"Super clean, much bigger space than I expected, amazing bathtub and thoughtful touches!"

24155499,562459463,2019-11-10,7858356,Deborah,The room is much larger and more private than the photos show. The neighborhood is very quiet; the bathtub is GREAT! Lisa includes extra touches and provides a complete breakfast. I really enjoyed staying here. It was close to Willamette and very convenient for my trip. It is one of the nicest Airbnbs that I have stayed in. Lisa was very quick at responding to questions. Thanks for a great stay.
24155499,564769030,2019-11-16,47012822,Ashley,"I am sure this has to be one of the best places to stay in Salem. The most thoughtful host I have ever stayed with. Lisa's notes, snacks and space is so lovingly put together for a very comfortable stay. The tub is amazing and the space and tools to create art is completely unique and I love it!"
24155499,578476818,2019-12-17,313472072,Matthias,Thanks for a very warm welcome with nice food in the fridge. It was very cute to have little notes everywhere around in the house how to use things and nice links to available amenities. A very well taken care of garden which must be a great asset in summer.
24155499,580461918,2019-12-22,3574458,Tamara,This lovely space was just the right environment for the deep focus and reflection I needed. I searched hard to find a place where I could work on a huge project over the weekend while enjoying my environment. Lisa's home was just perfect!
24155499,587253606,2020-01-02,3574458,Tamara,Lisa's home helps you understand the difference between an attractive space and a hospitable (and attractive) space. She adds many thoughtful touches to enhance guests' experiences. You feel pampered. I love the creative energy and carefully planned ambiance. I leave feeling refreshed!
24155499,589312997,2020-01-05,139977521,Quentin,Lisa's place was wonderful. The place was spotless with little unique touches throughout the place. The art station was a breath of fresh air with a cup of French press coffee in the morning. I would recommend staying here for multiple nights for anyone who needs a relaxing get away.
24155499,590154146,2020-01-07,8551695,David,Lisa's place is a perfect retreat. She thought of everything - personal touches galore. It truly changed the standard by which I judge other accommodations.
24155499,592246758,2020-01-12,44200531,Genevieve,Excellent place to stay in Salem. Lisa’s small personal touches made the accommodation memorable and relaxing.
24155499,593703508,2020-01-16,5839451,Craig,"We enjoyed Lisa's studio in Salem.  There were wonderful touches everywhere including coffee, tea and breakfast food in the kitchen.  We appreciated the central location and easy access to the ""downtown"" area.  We would be happy to stay with Lisa again."
24155499,595244256,2020-01-19,33126545,Patty,The best Airbnb experience of my life to date!!  I wanted to sell my house and move to Salem...that's how good it was and Lisa is an angel.  Always available to answer questions and going that extra (Website hidden by Airbnb) make sure my stay was number one..and it was!!!
24155499,596415684,2020-01-22,91506966,Ian,Second time at this cozy apartment. Should say it all. I plan to rent the next time I’m in Salem.
24155499,598191589,2020-01-26,121072775,Judith,Lovely apartment close to town and WU.  Extra special care with convenience items you might need while traveling and very well stocked kitchen and bath.
24155499,601044448,2020-02-02,174282502,Dale,"Absolutely loved the place!  Very roomy for a studio with lots of very thoughtful touches to make our stay pleasant.  Liked the secluded off street parking.  Would like to see the place during the summer- I bet the yard and garden will be gorgeous.  While we did not have friends traveling with us this time, the adjacent house would be great if we had been traveling with someone else, but wanted privacy while staying in close proximity."
24155499,603144589,2020-02-08,74688390,Kyle,This is such a cute place! Lisa's place is so nice and this was a wonderful stay. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in The Portland area. Lisa added such cute little touches to the place. Such a splendid place.

24155499,613385703,2020-03-01,49776746,Pharoah,"Amazing studio, definitely a place I’d recommend if you’re looking for accommodations in Salem."
24155499,614297129,2020-03-04,4824326,Kim,"Quiet location in a wooded neighborhood. Just a short walk to capitol/downtown, negating parking hassles. Art supplies and a variety of beverages and snacks in the fridge. I will book again."
24155499,616097846,2020-03-08,90190846,Savannah,Lisa is wonderful! The room is so nice and spacious. She provided toiletries as well in case you forget. She also provided snacks and little tips to help you in the room/around the area. The room was so clean and the hospitality was amazing! Location is nice and the room is beautiful. Would love to stay here again! Lisa makes it feel like a home away from home.
24155499,617744671,2020-03-13,158644705,Marni,"Lisa’s place is spectacular.  I thought I’d miss television but the space is so calming and therapeutic it was like being in a spa.  The art supplies are a wonderful touch. There was breakfast of bagels, eggs, cream cheese, and other goodies.  There were tips around the space that made the visit more enjoyable.  The soaking tub was amazing. 
It really made the trip to Salem.  Will definitely be my go to place when I return."
24155499,619510535,2020-03-17,70818262,Alicia,Amazing place! Reminds me of a spa every time I stay!
24155499,622869002,2020-04-21,20196453,Shiloh,"Lisa's place was just what we needed. We so appreciated what she has done with her sweet space.  We loved the tub!   Wow.. it was huge. The tub was super relaxing and Lisa provided some really nice bubble bath options.  I really was pleased to find a phone charger in the bedside drawer.  Since I am pretty forgetful about phone chargers, this was a life saver. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was so cute and perfect for what we needed.  The climate control in the room was also great. There was just so many sweet surprises in this neat and tidy space.  The spring view into the garden from the large window was exceptionally cheery. All the things in bloom- we came at just the right time!  All in all,  we feel Lisa truly goes over and above as a host.   :)"
24155499,624473074,2020-05-10,31044052,Jackie,"What a lovely stay! This is a large studio space with a very comfortable bed, lovely soaker tub, and nice kitchenette. Outdoor space is awesome! Lisa is a thoughtful host. Will stay here again!"
24155499,625531195,2020-05-21,195490764,Megan,Very clean and cozy! Had everything you would need and even more. Table with cute art supplies to get creative. The tub was so relaxing. Bed is sooo comfortable! Enjoyed a bagel with some eggs that was in the fridge :) made some hot cocoa at night.  The garden was beautiful! Left notes explainings things which I thought was super helpful! Will most definitely be coming back. Host kept in touch and just so sweet! Best Airbnb I've stayed in.
24155499,626368487,2020-05-26,258416606,Roy,Great place very relaxing. Thank you  Lisa
24155499,628014510,2020-06-06,347352260,Alexandra,Very bright and cheery space.  We loved our stay!
24155499,631525661,2020-06-22,348139512,Charles,It was a really amazing experience. Lisa was always very quick to respond to messages and provided so many little extras to make my stay feel special. The spaces were exceptionally clean and well maintained. The location is great and very close to anything you may need. I  actually would have stayed longer if it was available and would highly recommend it without any hesitation.
24155499,632077587,2020-06-25,3599616,Casper,"What an absolutely surprisingly awesome Airbnb. I was in town visiting family but not wanting to stay with the older parental unit folks due to Covid, etc. so I rented this spot last minute. The bed was heavenly - (and this is from someone who has sleep issues!+ bedding was also on point and not cheap. :) a private parking spot next to the unit is the kind of thing that is a big deal to me because I’m road tripping so my life is currently in my car. The bathtub was one of the main draws for me as I don’t have one back in my LA home but this one was no ordinary bathtub. I’m 5’4 and I swam in it practically - which is to say it’s a large tub perfectly suited for almost any human I imagine. The kitchen was not a full kitchen but I didn’t have any issues & still think I could have easily rented this place for a longer period and been perfectly fine with the amenities as is. Owner has a lovely sense of style & the cleanliness was much better than most Airbnbs. Absolutely nothing critical to say as so many lovely touches and thoughtfulness abound. The bath towels were also plush and plentiful which NEVER HAPPENS!! The only thing I needed which I didn’t have was a full length mirror which is one of those things I usually doublecheck for with the listing host since I need that to feel “put together” - however, it’s a pandemic and I don’t think it would have mattered since I’m rocking yoga pants and tshirts pretty exclusively these days. Lol. Wonderful spot!"
24155499,658753613,2020-08-30,247629108,Lesly,Its so beautiful. She was very thoughtful on our needs. Great area. Even has a little garden. It was just so nice.
24155499,662215162,2020-09-08,338567714,Amber,"I cannot say enough about how fantastic this place was! Lisa is the most thoughtful hostess we’ve ever experienced. The pictures online were very accurate representations of the suite and the price was phenomenal for the location. Lisa has so many small touches that made our stay so special! From fresh flowers by the bedside to fresh bagels in the fridge she has really put her guests in mind. The craft table was stocked for our enjoyment and there were fun, delicious smelling bubble baths by the tub.  We had one small issue while staying and she was very quick to respond and offer help (it was fixed that same day!). Absolutely 100% recommend this for anyone who wants to be pampered and have a stress-free vacation!"
24155499,663997367,2020-09-13,133729896,Anna,"Lisa is an excellent host! She has a lovely place with beautiful gardens, a large relaxing tub for a bubble bath, and art supplies for something fun to do. She also had books for my children which was such a nice touch. Lisa is a true host!"
24155499,668878111,2020-09-27,360767755,Valentia,My boyfriend and I loved this place . Such a relaxing and lovely place! Big thanks to the host for being a great host! Would really recommend this place!

24155499,671293856,2020-10-04,369266966,Beth,"Lisa's little touches in the airbnb are so welcoming.  From fresh flowers to a place to doodle and make art, to labels which explain how things are operated to bubble bath, this is above and beyond!  Lisa communicates quickly and answers any questions you may have. The bathtub in this airbnb is its own spa; a perfect place to unwind after a busy or stressful day."
24155499,700016371,2020-10-12,7649709,Aaron,"We loved staying at Lisa's place with her beautiful gardens, incredible soaking tub, and the many  personal touches that made us feel so welcome.  We really enjoyed the private, quiet and restful space."
24155499,701875922,2020-10-18,2458260,Matt,"Great and comfy spot with an amazing bathtub, good home base for exploring wine country. Bagels and teas were a really nice touch for breakfast. Thanks!"
24780208,260714061,2018-05-04,31674102,Anne,"Elizabeth truly is a “super” host. Having stayed at her lovely estate before (in one of the rooms in her home), I had come to expect all the amenities she provides to her guests — from cable TV and Wi-Fi to a convenient kitchenette set-up with a mini-refrigerator, coffee maker and breakfast pantry. On this occasion, however, I was able to book the cottage (next to the pool) and was so pleased with this new experience that offered a small living room (with an electric fireplace), a full kitchen with gas range/oven, microwave, toaster and full-size refrigerator, a dining table and ample countertop space for food preparation. And, Elizabeth has thought of everything for the cook! I discovered so many cooking tools and equipment, from measuring cups to frying pans, baking dishes and spatulas ... No plastic plates! Nice ceramic dishes, bowls, serving plates and glassware. The well-stocked bathroom with shower (and any toiletries I might have forgotten) is downstairs. Upstairs, I had a comfortable queen-size bed, a large desk, spacious closet and a HUGE television. Both rooms had their own electric heat pump, so it was easy to adjust each room for heating or cooling. As on my other visit, Elizabeth and her son, Cris, were available to assist me when I needed it (mostly for my cable and Wi-Fi questions). I highly recommend the cottage, especially if you are planning to have a longer visit in the Salem area."
24780208,262972431,2018-05-10,64967605,Elisha,"We spent our one year anniversary here. She had champagne, a card, and candy for us! Elizabeth was so helpful and kind. The best airbnb I've stayed at! She truly made our time there special!"
24780208,266281234,2018-05-19,81574977,Darlene,"I was only passing through but so glad I chose Elizabeth’s. She was very helpful and showed me around the home and property. This charming little cottage was a nice spot to unwind and relax after driving. A hot tub is available and a pool although the pool wasn’t ready to open yet. There is everything you need and a few extras, like fresh eggs from her chickens. I hope to stay again and spend more time in the area."
24780208,267473129,2018-05-21,154598224,Tina,Loved the location and Elizabeth was an amazing help..
24780208,267794505,2018-05-22,40709142,Amanda,"We booked this on a whim when we need to spend one night Salem. We could not have been happier. The location is amazing! You turn off a busy road and then into a secret garden. The hot tub was an incredible touch. 

We would be back! Thank you! "

The hosts were very helpful in answering any questions at any time of the day through the app.  I loved that it was dog friendly.  I really liked that it had very useful amenities both in the kitchen and in the bathroom. It was so much better than staying in a hotel
24780208,299828185,2018-07-31,127627323,Leslie,"Really enjoyed my 2-month stay.  Cottage was comfortable, very clean, well furnished with all of the amenities.  Location was perfect for my summer job in downtown Salem.  Elizabeth was very friendly, responsive and accommodating - always wanted to make sure that I had everything that I needed.  Check-in was very smooth - she sent directions and photos of the road sign, cottage entrance, parking spot, etc. which made her place easy to find.  Highly recommend.  I would stay there again."
24780208,301211893,2018-08-03,108774666,Carolyn,"Staying at Elizabeth’s guest cottage has been the best B&B experience ever!  The cottage is super clean and cozy, it has everything that we needed, everybody loved it!  Elizabeth is a great host, she not only showed the cottage that we booked but also many of the others which brought a great time to our kids.  I made a mistake in booking by missing one room, Elizabeth offered another room to help me get the issue resolved, that’s very generous and very impressive,  I felt that I was super lucky to chose Elizabeth’s house.  I would come back if I go by next time "
24780208,301766323,2018-08-04,202822076,Maria,Incredibly friendly host and very attentive to details in there Home. This was my first AirBnB experience and it was one for the books!

24780208,310577329,2018-08-19,100505768,Jenny,"If I could give 10 stars, I would! Elizabeth was so accommodating for our group and was quick in communication. We had a group of four and it was just perfect for us! She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. She seemed like a friend who we could ask if we needed anything or if we had any questions. We arrived very late and in the dark, but her directions were so clear, we had no trouble getting in. The house had everything we needed, was comfortable, and homey. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone coming to visit Salem!"
24780208,311235327,2018-08-20,25283455,Nicole,"What a great little place! We thoroughly enjoyed the pool, air conditioned rooms, and home-made banana bread Elizabeth provided for us!

The king size bed upstairs was so comfortable I didn’t want to leave the bed. Elizabeth provided fresh eggs, banana bread, almond milk and water in the fridge. The neighborhood is quiet and provides a peaceful place to rest after a long day. Elizabeth is a fantastic host and if we are in the area again we would definitely choose her place to stay! Thanks again! "

The host provided fresh eggs from her chickens, a new half gallon of milk, yogurt, English muffins, fresh fruit, etc. Lots of seating, a TV on the lower level and in the bedroom, comfy King-size bed, clean bathroom - even a private swimming pool for use if wanted. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. And Elizabeth, the host, was an excellent communicator. Perfect place to stay."

The cottage was an amazing value compared to the prices of hotels. The bed anad pillows were extremely comfortable! She had wonderful ameneties and the self check in was extremely easy. We really wish we could've had more time to spend at the cottage. Definitely a great find for us.  Highly recommend!"

They said: the place was very clean and neat. There were eggs in the fridge from Elizabeth's chickens which was very thoughtful of her. There was a few issues that came up but Elizabeth was able to get it sorted out. Also she was very understanding and sweet to let my friend stay pass checkout time for a couple of hours as I was taking my exam. Thank you for the wonderful time! I highly recommend!"
24780208,325815815,2018-09-20,216299890,Brien,"We were pulling into Salem last minute, and I finally heard back from a couple rooms that they weren’t able to take us in, so I scrolled through Airbnb and  gave it one last shot, and in less than  a minute Elizabeth  accepted my request and contacted me. It was unbelievable how she took such good care of us on such short notice. The place was better than we could’ve hoped for, and our host was very kind as she welcomed us in the driveway."

Loved the homemade jam and fruit and having the option to cook meals, though our schedule didn’t leave us time for that.  This  will be our go-to choice whenever we come back to the area for visits!!"
24780208,345329860,2018-11-04,126207628,Shelby,"The space is great, close to a lot of fun things, we only spent half a day actually in Salem but the riverfront Park is great, and we had a wonderful time thrift shopping at Engelberg Antiks-huge selection. A full kitchen, made two big meals there, everything for basic need for dishes, I brought my own lasagna pan but skillets and serving dishes and utensils were provided. Basic breakfast supplies, clean and stylish space. It was quiet and peaceful, the dvd selection is lacking so if you’re banking on a group movie I would bring your own from redbox or something for the downstairs tv but we ended up playing trivial pursuit and had an even better time. Host was wonderful, very attentive and hospitable. Was great for my boyfriend and I with my brother and his girlfriend for dinner and breakfast. Easy entry, had everything we needed there and felt very at home, highly recommend for your stay in Salem or visiting nearby.  Host mentioned (Hidden by Airbnb) directions are slightly off but Apple maps took me right to it so just a heads up that if you have an iPhone you should have no problems finding it :)"
24780208,346198363,2018-11-07,29963693,Micca,"Stay here. I promise, you’ll end up liking it more than your own home. The lodging is stylish and comfortable the setting is absolutely beautiful, and Elizabeth is an amazing hostess. This location is a gem and a jewel for any traveler."

Fridge was loaded with terrific goodies, including organic milk. The beds were really comfortable and even though it is small, 2 adults with 2 teens and two dogs did well in the space. Elizabeth was a terrific host and allowed us to come in early. The price was awesome for all the great amenities she provided."

24780208,368419211,2019-01-06,7959160,MaiLinh,"Some friends and I came to Salem to visit nearby wineries. Elizabeth's place had all we needed- a kitchen to make a meal, coffee, towels for the hot tub, a radio, TV with cable to catch some playoff football, and a convenient location to downtown for dinner and wineries not far away. The hottub was nice and hot. Her property has big trees around which was nice.

It's an older home with some character, but good value for what you pay."
24780208,368975340,2019-01-08,62556793,Kirk,Great place to land for the night!
24780208,401184696,2019-01-13,26761081,Rick,"You are in for a treat here!  You have your own parking space and enter a gate into a courtyard with a pool and a hot tub!  Easy keyless access and a refrigerator with everything you need for a nice breakfast in the morning...even 1/2 and 1/2 for coffee!  The place was cozy with many special touches that helped us feel relaxed and comfy.  The location is convenient to downtown.  If you are a vegetarian, check out Taproot for a great meal!"
24780208,402811263,2019-01-19,143165565,Michelle,"Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Elizabeth's guest house. The space was adorable and full of all of the amenities that we could think of! We especially appreciated the selection of breakfast items.. as graduate students on the run to classes, being able to grab and go was much appreciated! We can't wait to stay again, especially when the weather warms up, since we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful backyard and pool!"
24780208,403428948,2019-01-20,163130204,Ashley,The stay was great. Very hospitable and great place!
24780208,404097243,2019-01-22,26603705,Danielle & Joseph,Everything you need in the kitchen & bedroom! Very thoughtful baby accessories. Comfortable bedroom. Elizabeth greeted us upon arrival & provided excellent communication throughout our two night stay. Thanks again!

24780208,406240228,2019-01-28,85377735,Nimi,"Lovely space.  Private, comfortable, nice kitchen area.  Elizabeth provided eggs, bread, cereal, coffee,  and an extra baked good for breakfast, which made the morning so easy.  Even the fold-out bed in the living room was comfortable.  We didn't take advantage of the hot tub, but it was a great additional amenity.  All in all, a lovely place to stay."
24780208,410158698,2019-02-09,43775219,Charissa,"Elizabeth's cottage was clean, comfortable, and convenient for our Salem adventures. She made every effort to make sure we had every amenity available including fresh eggs, granola, and fruit.  We would definitely visit again."
24780208,411236879,2019-02-11,76181166,Brittany,We chose Elizabeth's place because it was a short distance to the local wineries.  We were very pleased with our stay.  Her home was beautiful and comfortable.  She responded quickly to our questions and was very accommodating.  The hot tub was also very nice after a day at the wineries!
24780208,412113323,2019-02-14,97966889,Esther,"Cute little two level airbnb. The electric fireplace is a nice cozy touch in the winter and Elizabeth does an amazing job stocking every amenity possible. She is extremely responsive and helpful, even offered to help me unload the first night! I found this location ideal for my trips downtown and to the capitol for my business stay. Very close to food places (could walk if you want), a drive through coffee kiosk, and a roths grocery. Only about 2 miles away from the Public Library. Wifi and everything worked great. I would stay here again. Very clean and neat. Was very cozy while I was there and it rained every day. Only thing I would say is keep in mind you are walking past a swimming pool and make sure you are aware of this, elizabeth provides a flashlight at the carport.  I had no issues and didn't need the flashlight. I found it fun to be back behind the pool. Only regret was that it was too rainy to try out the hot tub."
24780208,412917600,2019-02-16,241154928,Richard,"Really enjoy the cottage, nice and quiet."
24780208,413612065,2019-02-17,240280366,Rebecca,I was very happy staying here at Elizabeth's B&B and would recommend if your in the area to stay there! I know I plan on coming back!

Super comfortable bed and it's within easy walking distance of groceries, restaurants, etc. Elizabeth was communicative and flexible with changes I needed to make. The place was clean and comfortable with wonderful amenities."
24780208,421545432,2019-03-09,143165565,Michelle,"This was our second time staying at Elizabeth's wonderful guest suite, and just like before, this place was charming, well-stocked, and made us feel right at home. Cannot wait to stay again next time we are in Salem!"

24780208,425113564,2019-03-17,61812136,Meg,The home was fresh and clean and wonderfully private. There was fresh fruit and breakfast items available as well as many little needful things.  The hot tub was wonderful! Elizabeth was easily  communicative with any questions :)
24780208,425727496,2019-03-18,33070618,Katerina,There were so many thoughtful touches. If I could I would of stayed there another night.

24780208,429383429,2019-03-27,29636134,Michele,"Convenient location, comfy king bed, and fresh baked banana bread!"
24780208,431386391,2019-03-31,46041663,Michelle,"There is no doubt that this space is absolutely worth the money. I personally feel like the photos don’t do it justice. My husband and I stayed here for a local wedding and we were thankful that we were  allowed to bring our Yorkie. The space is updated and has everything anyone could need. Our only issue with our stay were the ants... My husband and I were in a bit of a rush upon our arrival because we didn’t want to be late to the wedding so we dropped our items and our dog off in a rush and did not realize that the whole bottom area of the unit was covered in ants. Yes they were only sugar ants and yes Elizabeth had mentioned she was having a little problem with the ants but gosh there were so many we ended up excluding ourselves to the bedroom after spraying ant spray all downstairs. My husband and I also could not get the AC unit in the bedroom to work. Mind you, we are very tech savvy and even went to the lengths to look up the exact model online and just couldn’t get it to work. Aside from those two issues the place was great."
24780208,433491527,2019-04-06,52651507,Heather,"This bnb has excellent reviews for a reason. Elizabeth truly is a SUPER HOST and a lovely person. She respects your privacy but makes sure you are having the best stay possible. We stayed in the cottage and it was the best bnb experience we’ve ever had. She has thought of every detail. The space is clean, comfortable and well appointed. The kitchen is set up with nice appliances and everything you need. 
On arrival she was very welcoming to our family. She even loaned our toddler some toys and gave us a tour of the chickens and ducks when we arrived. I really can’t say enough good things about our experience and the location. It's central to everything in Salem and yet is very peaceful and relaxing."
24780208,436305540,2019-04-12,89847029,Lauren,"Lovely and cozy place. Lots of thoughtful touches. Bed pretty soft if you are used to a hard mattress. Otherwise, perfect!"
24780208,437447737,2019-04-14,238945690,Debra,"Very cute little cottage!  We used the hot tub a few times and that was nice.  Elizabeth even had items stocked in the refrigerator for breakfast.  She also stocks many other amenities you might need.  Towels, a fully stocked kitchen and even toiletries were all available to us!  It was a relaxing stay and we were close to all the places we wanted to go!  I would recommend it to anyone!  ❤️"
24780208,438887116,2019-04-17,46800977,Debbie,"It was a very cute and cozy guest house.  Great location too.  Unfortunately, we ran into a minor ant problem.  According to the host, it can happen at this time of the year.  I would appreciate some kind of hints to set my expectations right."
24780208,439795600,2019-04-19,239543786,Jacks,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and we couldn't have chosen a better host! Elizabeth was incredibly nice, very responsive and she even left a beautiful arrangement of roses and champagne for our anniversary. Truly happy with our experience!"
24780208,441227838,2019-04-21,248716727,Devan,My husband and I are from the valley but currently live in Bend. We needed a place where we could have the space and privacy we wanted with our new baby and our dog. This was the perfect place for our little family to stay while visiting our friends and family! I would highly recommend this place to anyone but especially traveling families. We will definitely stay here in the future!
24780208,442101521,2019-04-22,4456185,Fiona,"This place is great for a single person or a couple. Very clean, lots of small touch amenities and the hot tub was really nice. Elizabeth met us when we pulled up, but if she wasn't there, the check-in directions we're very clear - including the fact that (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps doesn't work! Great experience and good deal, especially for a quick get away from the city."
24780208,442558953,2019-04-23,55707938,Rebecca,"We had such a lovely stay.  The cottage was adorable and comfortable.  Elizabeth was so helpful and quick to respond. The location is so convenient to shopping and groceries,  and she provided many options for breakfast that made everyone in our family happy. It's secluded and relaxing.  I highly recommend, and would definitely stay there again."
24780208,444257438,2019-04-27,2698997,Holly,Elizabeth’s place was just what we expected. I don’t like having to go downstairs in the middle of the night but other than that her place was perfect. She even provided toys for our grand baby who visited. We’re looking forward to going back in warmer weather so we can take advantage of the pool. Elizabeth was always available to answer our questions or deal with any concerns.
24780208,445665568,2019-04-29,256508326,Joshua,"Elizabeth was a fantastic host! She warned us our GPS would get us lost, so she sent step-by-step directions including pictures. She met us in the driveway to welcome us at Vista Manor, then showed us around the property. She even supplied fresh eggs from her chickens for breakfast!"
24780208,446568415,2019-05-01,229347785,Heather,"Elizabeth's place is a gem in the city. It's quiet, comfortable, and most important properly equipped. Anything you need Elizabeth will take care of. It was still too cold to use the pool, but the hot tub was amazing and the perfect answer to soak off a 7 hour drive. The house was clean, well stocked, plenty of everything, and Elizabeth is a great host and I would definitely stay here again in the future."
24780208,447448444,2019-05-03,35844478,Helen,"We finished our honeymoon at Elizabeth's place and it was absolutely perfect. Elizabeth was very hospitable and as well as being greeted by a clean and tidy place to stay we were given juice, eggs, bread, fruit and freshly baked banana loaf. We would definitely stay here again and have recommended to friends. Thanks Elizabeth!"
24780208,452735909,2019-05-13,13973584,Ellen,We loved staying at this cottage. It was perfect for 2 or 3 people. Elizabeth was gracious and helpful. It was great that we could bring our dog too! We will stay there again next time we are in Salem.
24780208,453053144,2019-05-14,4123381,Linda,"Elizabeth’s guest house was just as advertised—clean, private, and comfortable.  It is situated on a fairly large estate where Elizabeth has a variety of animals and a greenhouse that guests may chose to enjoy if they wish.  I really enjoyed seeing the baby ducklings and meeting the resident cats and dogs.  I was on business so didn’t get to enjoy my surroundings for long, but it was a pleasant place to unwind for a night.  I would happily stay again."
24780208,453746723,2019-05-16,166580797,Jenny,The location was perfect. Nice and private.
24780208,457280305,2019-05-23,201445234,Gal,"This is a cute guest cottage. The 1st floor is a nice living area with a full kitchen and bathroom. Upstairs is the bedroom. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are super soft and it is very quiet. We had a very relaxing stay. Elizabeth is a great host. She was very welcoming and responsive!"

After a couple days of hiking we throughly enjoyed the use of the hot tub. This is a great area/part of Salem to stay in, close to good restaurants and the downtown part of Salem. We felt very welcomed there. Would happily stay again!"

Big comfy bed with big fluffy pillows and nice big flat screen in bedroom . kitchen is pretty well stocked had everything we needed .Nice quiet property with peaceful outdoor atmosphere. We came pretty early in season to early for pool was still being cleaned but looks like it would be a great time in the summer . I love that she has recycle bins that are easily labeled for dispensing! thanks for being eco friendly! So many vacation rentals are not and we drive around trying to find recycling bins definitely a plus for us!
24780208,465996043,2019-06-08,263316323,Kymberlee,The guest house is cute. The stairs get tricky with suitcases and midnight bathroom trips. We were greeted with a smile by Elizabeths daughter and Elizabeth always responded quickly.

24780208,472020643,2019-06-18,101993336,Mazloy,Elizabeth was an exceptional host. She was so thoughtful and the sundries in the home were above and beyond. The space is lovely and we enjoyed a cozy dip in the sparkling clean jacuzzi. Elizabeth offered a tip to visit an incredible winery and we had a magical time in Salem thanks to her. The beds were really comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. The whole experience was warm and inviting. I would highly recommend this place and the host!
24780208,472962449,2019-06-20,37743772,Kirsten,"We stayed at Elizabeth’s while visiting family in town & absolutely LOVED her space. It’s super family friendly for those traveling with infants/toddlers...

Elizabeth was so sweet and sincere. We had our own private cottage on her property and in the fridge were fresh eggs from her chickens and English muffins and a few yogurts. Was so sweet to have such a thoughtful gift considering we were constantly busy on this trip for our friends wedding. The hot tub and the pool were so nice to come back to. Over all this was an amazing experience and great memories."

Lovely special touches like flowers, breakfast items, etc. I look forward to staying here again!"

24780208,532385557,2019-09-19,31518648,Sandra,Perfect for a couple rather than 4 adults...but we only stayed one night and my sons managed on the pull-out couch. Coffee and basic kitchen necessities were there which is very nice. Some fruit and eggs were in the fridge.

24780208,547294787,2019-10-14,63290458,Adam,"If you are looking to stay in Salem, Elizabeth provides a great experience! There were so many nice touches that we were blown away by! Highlights were homemade jam (I am assuming) and fresh eggs from her chickens!
This is a small place with a large bed and great amenities. You can easily access the University and downtown by car or walk (if you need the extra steps). We enjoyed being able to keep up our morning runs in a safe, well lit neighborhood.
We will be looking to stay here again!"

Very relaxing with great kitchen space."
24780208,567141657,2019-11-21,34140416,Janet,"A great little place for 2-3 people max.  The king-size bed was so very comfortable; just the right firmness. The sofa bed was a bit soft for our son so he slept on the floor on his Japanese roll bed. Otherwise, completely efficient with everything anyone would need to prepare meals. We were in Salem to help restore an old Airstream and the hot tub and pool were greatly appreciated at the end of the day.  Elizabeth was very gracious and attentive to any requests, but on the other hand,  we felt we had complete privacy.  A great, secure location; close to downtown Salem and local grocer."
24780208,568793806,2019-11-24,184263904,Elizabeth,One of my favorite spots to date & if we visit Salem overnight again we’ll look to book here. Super cute inside and the hot tub was a great bonus!

Great decor and very easy check in . Excellent carport . Elizabeth is kind and thoughtful as a hostess! I’ll be back again the next time I need to come to Salem.
24780208,576518760,2019-12-13,316123643,Phu,"If this place is open and your considering it, don’t hesitate- book it!! Cottage is in back of house and very private. Amazing hospitality, quick to response, very easy self check-in instructions, very clean, well-stocked kitchen – even with rice cooker with rice supplied, numerous amenities, large flat screen TV with Infinity Cable, fast Internet, and knowledge of local places to eat.  Location could not be any better, central – within short walk or drive to everything including a park to walk my dog.  Comfortable bed and easy access to pool/relaxing spa.  Elizabeth was a thoughtful and responsive host. Would love to come back again next time in the area."

24780208,579861583,2019-12-21,191594094,Margaret,"This is really a charming place to stay.   It is wonderfully located in Salem, in a very nice neighborhood, close to downtown.  But still manages to be quiet and secluded.  But the best part is Elizabeth's attention to your needs and her very sincere desire that you enjoy your stay.  Which we did."
24780208,580539047,2019-12-22,1761368,Lisa,"Elizabeth is a warm, responsive, accommodating host.  The place was beautifully and colorfully decorated, with many thoughtful touches.  Slept well, woke, well...and would stay here again."

The location was ideal, close to downtown and lots of shopping around the corner including a lot of good restaurants. Elizabeth checked in with us almost daily to see if there was anything we needed which was so kind. We will be staying again!"
24780208,584173806,2019-12-29,827576,Akshay,"We loved our weekend stay at Elizabeth's place. The kitchen was fully stocked with breakfast fixings, which was very convenient. It's quaint and in a great location."

24780208,593696049,2020-01-16,28369674,Ramond,"Everything about my stay at Elizabeth’s was perfect. Complete privacy in a comfortable and spacious guest house. The fridge was stocked with breakfast food and bottled water. Coffee and condiments were stocked. There is a DELICIOUS hot tub, and I even had a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir waiting for me as a welcome gift! I wish I could give the space 6 stars!  Definitely one of the top Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at EVER :-)"
24780208,594498053,2020-01-18,62065,Janet,Another great stay at Elizabeth's lodgings! Will be back again!
24780208,595781191,2020-01-20,143998677,Molly,"What a great place to stay! It's literally right next door to dining, grocery and main roads, but feels secluded. We're a family of 4 (two littles), plus a dog and we were super comfortable. The host was amazing and we look forward to staying again."
24780208,597503398,2020-01-25,128290242,Carol,"Loved the cottage. Lots of little extras, felt very secure. Nice kitchen...all round awesome."

24780208,599014975,2020-01-28,2143228,Cynthia,I love the cottage!   It’s my first time staying there and I was so surprised when I arrived late and saw fresh eggs and English muffins in the fridge.   So grateful as I was starving.      Comfortable bed.   Nice tv.     Great place.  Easy check in.     Love the host.
24780208,599311915,2020-01-29,2143228,Cynthia,Wonderful place to stay!

24780208,600073171,2020-01-31,33815,Ben,"Great spot, right in the thick of Salem.  Comfy beds, very useful kitchen, clear and accurate photos and communication!  Thanks, Elizabeth!"
24780208,601157919,2020-02-02,87840449,Teleah,"Elizabeth is a WONDERFUL host who is highly responsive and seems to live for creating a great experience for her cherished guests. The hot tub was amazing, the guest cottage was secure and private. I felt safe and like I was on a true vacation. Thank you! I will definitely be returning."

24780208,603915218,2020-02-09,143630087,Jessie,"Elizabeth's cottage was so cute and homey! It has absolutely everything you could need or want. She has thoughtful touches in the bathroom like toothbrushes, face wipes, and almost all the small stuff one might forget to pack. She also leaves a few small breakfast and snack items for you as well as providing a kitchen with pots, pans, plates galore. The king bed is comfy and the sofa bed is great for extra people. We were 5 people in the small space but it felt great! There is plenty of parking for cars too which was great.  Elizabeth was quick to respond to all my questions and concerns. She really cares about her guests' experience. I wish we had stayed longer! 10/10 would recommend!"
24780208,604571183,2020-02-11,40709142,Amanda,Another great stay!
24780208,605150785,2020-02-13,2143228,Cynthia,"Always a great place to stay.  This particular stay had special homemade bread in the refrigerator for me, Elizabeth met me at the parking (carport) and actually carried my suitcase in.  She showed me a few thing in the cottage - and even put a phone charger in there for me (because she knows I tend to forget when I travel) .  Always a pleasure to stay there."
24780208,606884208,2020-02-16,74109293,Taylor,"Wow! This is way better than I expected! The hot tub is so perfect! It didn’t make my skin itchy and having the pool all lit up next to it. The bed was SOOOO comfortable along with the sheets, pillows AND blankets !! I was so impressed! It had everything we could have thought of needing and then some! She accommodated to my infants need with a play pin and highchair! I will definitely be staying here again! :)"
24780208,607484234,2020-02-17,3509751,Lindsey,"Cozy, wonderful stay! We played scrabble and used the hot tub.  Our dog was able to roam around the fenced yard.  Great place to unwind, thank you!"
24780208,612086799,2020-02-28,114412698,Ben,Expect to be treated well and relax in a very comfortable setting.
24780208,613809416,2020-03-02,14696160,Alan,"Elizabeth has a very comfortable and thoughtful space. It has all the amenities and touches to make your stay very comfortable. I think if you are taller than 6'3"" and 225 pounds the shower and walk upstairs will be a little tight. By far, this studio 2-level is in the upper end of quality and service."
24780208,614583099,2020-03-05,2143228,Cynthia,"Elizabeth is always so thoughtful.  I appreciate her warming up the place before we arrived - the fresh fruit is great, and it's always like ""home""."

24780208,616812296,2020-03-10,43531648,Crystal,"Easy parking and centrally located, and comes with great communication from the host!"
24780208,617715404,2020-03-13,154504216,Sterling,"I had an event to attend and Elizabeth took the time to let me know how far it was from her home.  She was extremely helpful and responsive.  She also respected my autonomy and privacy.  The Air BnB was conscientiously stocked with all of those little comforts of home: Kleenex, Qtips, scissors, etc. and the kitchen was also mature with all of the apparatuses and utensils one would need.  There were many thoughtful considerations: water, fruit, etc.

I absolutely loved the detailed check in instructions with pictures making locating, parking, and gaining access so easy.  I had no problem finding the place and there was ample parking in the carport.  The majority of the pathway from the carport to the Air BnB location is cement, so rolling suitcases work fine and you don’t have to worry about muddy shoes on a rainy day unloading your car.  I also felt extremely safe in the neighborhood.

The only consideration I would pass along would be that if you are a light sleeper, there is a large dumpster for the neighboring apartment complex right beneath the bedroom window.  On both days (a Thursday and Friday) the dumpster came crashing down at around 6:15 am.  One day it was caused by the garbage truck emptying it, and it sounded like the garbage came again the next day, but it was likely someone putting garbage inside.  The second day I was hoping to sleep in a little bit was unable to after that.  For someone who is not a light sleeper, this would probably wouldn’t be an issue."
24780208,619704458,2020-03-18,38845427,Elana,"Perfect location beautiful outside and in, hot tub was amazing, fresh eggs and lots of xtra thank you best Airbnb ever"

24780208,642950692,2020-07-26,345143583,Phillip,We really enjoyed our stay.  Very comfortable.  Felt more roomey than photos depicted.  Elizabeth is very kind and makes you feel at home.  Good privacy.  Excellent location in town. Great value.
24780208,643990220,2020-07-29,65989638,Tammy,Very helpful flexible host. Air conditioning works great . Nice set up for 4. Pool was a nice bonus .
24780208,645304256,2020-08-01,122295976,Antonia,"Vista Manor was so much more than we expected with incredibly thoughtful details and a warm, welcoming environment.  We initially chose this stay to celebrate our anniversary because of the hot tub (clean and wonderful) and it's proximity to In-n-Out (only 20 minutes away), but would have been happy just hanging out in the space all day.  It was beautifully furnished, clean, and had everything you could need.  We'll definitely be returning to explore the area more!"

24780208,646755306,2020-08-04,1559859,Kale,"King bed upstairs with air conditioning, couch and desk allow for more functional space upstairs.  Pullout twin/full on main living space allowed for our daughter to have some alone time.  Full refrigerator, stove and all the kitchen supplies one would need are readily available.  Unheated swimming pool in the summer makes for a refreshing, almost shocking, afternoon dip.  In our nine years of airbnb, Elizabeth has the best communication of all the ""world"".  Hope to stay again.  Super lucky to enjoy her manor."
24780208,647086233,2020-08-05,70432240,Kristina,"Great place to stay, very cozy ❤️"
24780208,647832860,2020-08-07,355725627,Kattie,This was our first time ever vacationing like this and Elizabeth made it a wonderful experience. She was so kind and showed us how to use everything! She had this amazing book with suggestions and places to eat and things to do and we used that to plan a lot of our day. We went to ACME cafe which was 10/10 for breakfast which Elizabeth had recommended and it was within walking distance of the cottage. Such a relaxing and needed vacation. Thank you Elizabeth for making it such a great vacation. We will be coming back :)
24780208,648403176,2020-08-08,353309151,Aysia,"Elizabeth’s cottage is perfect. It’s clean with tons of amenities that you might need during your stay. Her pool and hot tub are a great bonus, too. Her whole property is beautiful and tucked back off the main road, which is so nice for a city like Salem. She’s a great host with great hospitality! If you’re rolling through Salem, this is where you need to stay."
24780208,649901474,2020-08-11,43388464,Kelly,"We had a nice time in the cottage. It was really nice to have ketchup, salt, olive oil etc in the cupboards and we didn’t use any, but thought it was a thoughtful touch that she had lots of bathroom supplies available and fresh flowers in vases around the cottage. The fresh fruit and eggs were also very kind.

Elizabeth’s communication while we were there was excellent. She was very accommodating and responsive. Our young children really enjoyed feeding the chickens and bunny and petting 2 of the sweet cats.

We felt safe and the house was clean.

The listing did mention that the pool was shared and was not heated. But I didn’t give it much thought since it would be in late August, I figured it would be fine. Unfortunately, it was too chilly for me and the kids to go in, but other guests swam with no complaints, so it’s likely we are just cold water wimps.

We would rent from Elizabeth again without hesitation."
24780208,650247807,2020-08-12,62806209,Kaysi,"Elizabeth’s place is truly in a beautiful spot.  I was surprised to find the accommodations were more spacious than I expected based on the photos, and our little family was quite comfortable there.  (My husband & I have two kids who were with us — a toddler & an infant.)  We appreciated thoughtful touches like the bowl full of delicious fruit that was waiting for us when we arrived and, though we didn’t get a chance to enjoy them, the farm fresh eggs that were left for us in the fridge.  Elizabeth was so kind as to invite us to join her out at the pool after our arrival, and although we ended up staying indoors to rest, we appreciated her kindness & hospitality.  We enjoyed our stay."
24780208,653902844,2020-08-20,286715283,Alexia,"Elizabeth is a great host! Super attentive and kind, and her response time was always almost right away. Her home is absolutely gorgeous and the hot tub and pool were great!"

Parking was great (inside the house property, not on the street).  Very clean, comfortable downstairs with all the kitchen amenities, and very comfortable bedroom, tv, etc.  Not a large space, but well designed and very pleasant place.  I would definitely return!"

24780208,672977191,2020-10-10,184862599,Courtney,Appreciated the eggs and fruit for breakfast before our adventures inside and outside of Salem. Lovely guest house! Great location. Elizabeth is wonderful!
24780208,673646834,2020-10-11,133962589,Elijah,Never had a host be so quick to respond to questions with a manor of kindness. I would recommend staying here to all. It’s very cozy and easy to make a temporary home in.

She really puts her own touch to making the stay worth it ! We had everything we could’ve needed and definitely will be coming back. Side note about the area, we had an amazing delivery from the Chinese Hong Kong house , delicious !"
24780208,702597746,2020-10-21,15863857,Marisa,"Elizabeth is a top notch host.  Her guest cottage has EVERYTHING you need,  plus stuff you didn't realize you needed until you see it. From breakfast for tomorrow morning to a sewing kit in the bathroom to a throw blanket to wrap around your shoulders Elizabeth has thought of everything. The bed is super comfy. The place is as clean as a pin. There is a full kitchen. I could have stayed forever."
25425938,275281877,2018-06-10,164897642,Dan N Angelina,"Me and my family had a wonderful time staying in this beautiful home. It's very close to shopping centers and close to a theme park for the little kids. Very clean home and are host and her family made us all feel welcome in their home. Jenni always answered any questions I had in a timely manner. I will definitely be staying here again. 
Thank you Jenni!"
25425938,278259942,2018-06-17,168818971,Jeff,"I would recommend this house to anyone! Great comfy beds, very clean home.
The backyard setting is quiet and private, they have the nicest place on the street for sure. Jenni is kind and thoughtful, a great host. The BBQ, Hot tub, sound system, so many nice amenities. The cherry tree was a bonus with fresh cherries."
25425938,281357866,2018-06-24,192150794,Doug,"Quiet, end of culdesac location.  Close to shopping, food and all the activities of the city. Jenni’s place will cost you the same as many hotels but is much nicer. I could live in the back yard happily."
25425938,284530240,2018-07-01,133646689,Erik,Excellent place to stay. Will stay there again.
25425938,287105221,2018-07-07,95199803,Larry/Jill,Comfortable home in a great location! Jenni is a sweet hostess and communicates quickly and is super helpful!
25425938,295034628,2018-07-22,71596019,Lisa,"This family really knows how to host. They have the home prepared in a way that renters can easily keep our groceries and belongings separated from their home. We rent all over the country from various spots and this home, hands down, was easily in my top two. 

You can feel the energy of love and an ambiance of family. It allows for a deep breath inward as you try to settle in. The master bedroom acts as a retreat of its own. A walk back in time. 

Our teenage boys learned what a turn table was all about and loved seeing how “old people” used to listen to music. 

The outside backyard is incredible. We roasted s’mores on the outside fire pit and all relaxed. 

She had all that is listed in the write of and more. Immaculate, clean, kind, loving, spacious home located in a very awesome and safe neighborhood.

Thank you Jenni & family for helping us repair what a (Hidden by Airbnb) made a mistake on. We would have been in bad shape without you. 

Thank you for a wonderful weekend!"
25425938,311189919,2018-08-20,85236271,Orly,"Jenni is a great host.

She was so quick to respond to any needs. We are very grateful for the use of the home that brought so many of us together to celebrate my brother’s life. Thank you!"
25425938,431366416,2019-03-31,101426482,Craig,Great place to stay with a nice outdoor area as well!

25425938,633384217,2020-06-29,179456730,Amanda,"Jenni was a perfect host.  Her home was beautiful and spotless. She provided all the details we needed up front and her communication was quick and accurate which made our stay that much more enjoyable.   Check-out was a breeze.  And when we left some items behind, Jenni arranged it so we could have family in town pick up the items to be mailed to us.  The only downside to our trip was we wished we had more time to enjoy the home!"
25425938,646051656,2020-08-02,274637534,Julie,This house just feels like home. It has everything you need and more. Very clean and comfortable. The host is great to work with and very accommodating. You won’t be disappointed.
25425938,655643589,2020-08-23,33163972,Kristine,"Jenni’s house is very spacious and very clean.  We enjoyed hanging out in the family room watching the large screen TV while we were there, as well as playing their collection of games.  The foosball table was fun too.  
The kitchen was well stocked with coffee and all the cookware we needed.  It’s so nice when traveling to be able to make your own dinner.  But Jenni also had restaurant recommendations for us when we asked.  Her home was a comfortable base for us while we explored the area."
25873321,281387044,2018-06-24,54799501,Christine,"Stylishly decorated with new furniture, comfortable and clean. Kyle thoughtfully provided everything in this space—from Keurig machine to bottled water and snacks to hair drier.  There’s a small kitchenette area with hot plate and mini fridge, plates, kitchen knives, glass ware, etc.  The property is awesome as well—in the woods with deer commonly visiting the property.  I very much enjoyed my stay. Thank you, Kyle!"

Super cute and decorated with a nice and clean look. Lots of goodies and snacks provided by host. Small kitchenette but had everything you needed. It’s almost private except the laundry room is shared with the guests in the ensuite.
25873321,292330759,2018-07-17,31752278,Vanessa,"Staying with Kyle was an exceptional experience. My partner and I stayed for ten nights when we were first moving to the area and Kyle was over-the-top kind and welcoming to us and our critters. His apartment is wonderfully put together and includes many thoughtful touches that made us feel cozy and at home. He was easy to communicate with, both before and during our stay,  and offered us great local tips on things to check out. And finally, his location is beyond amazing. We saw baby deer almost every day and woke up each morning to birds singing. It was overall a fantastic experience and we are grateful for having such an excellent host!"
25873321,295060260,2018-07-22,18776980,Johnny,"We had a wonderful stay at Kyle's place. The amenity that he provided is just amazing. A very comfortable bed, a upscale bathroom and a well stocked refrigerator are just among the few things that he provides. The property is secluded in the woods, yet only minutes away to city center. We had nice conversations, and he is just a great host. We wished we can stay longer! Thank you Kyle!"
25873321,296375354,2018-07-25,93569594,David,"Kyle’s place is spacious, relaxing, and includes many special touches that were welcome surprises after a long, hot day. Stay here if you are in the area!"
25873321,297936267,2018-07-28,178648796,Marie,"This is a very lovely place ! 
The accomodation is locates five minutes from the city, and yet on the middle of the woods ! 
 We saw deers, chipmunks, squirrel and  nice birds. 

The host  gave  us an excellent welcome ! He helped us for etablish our iterares,  he answered very quicly for helping us, he was very caring . 

But he also knows how to be discreet and we felt comfortable,  and I felt especially good in the hammoc (Website hidden by Airbnb) :-)

The housing is very nice and spacious, impeccable,  and well equiped. 
The best adress in Oregon ! 

Excellent adresse . L'hôte nous a réservé un excellent accueil : il nous a aidés à établir nos itinéraires, nous a donné des idées de sorties, de petites adresses pour nos courses, il a répondu rapidement à toutes nos petites questions.  Mais il a su aussi faire preuve de discrétion et nous laisser vivre notre vie .  
Nous nous sommes sentis très à l'aise dans ce magnifique petit logement et nous y avons passé du bon temps !  J'ai aimé passer de longs moments de lecture dans le hamac . J'ai pu observer des écureuils , des chipmunks, de beaux oiseaux et même un chevreuil femelle  et son faon . 

 Le logement est situé à dix minutes à peine de la ville, et pourtant au milieu des bois .  
"
25873321,304066849,2018-08-08,192483596,Lisa,"IMMACULATE!  This place is beautiful! Kyle is very nice, although I only saw him the first night. I truly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. It is secluded and we enjoyed the deer and chipmunks that cane around to say “hi” each day. There isn’t a kitchen sink, but that wasn’t an issue for us. The bathroom sink was more than adaquate for our needs. The bed is extremely comfortable. The sheets feel very clean and soft. Kyle pays attention to many details and  has great decorative style. We loved this place! "
25873321,306608154,2018-08-12,40714923,Svetlana,Kyle’s place is a true gem! I wish we would have planned for a longer stay. Very comfortable bed and the place had everything you could possibly need. Great location to visit Willamette Valley. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. Don’t miss this place!
25873321,314441859,2018-08-26,79728045,Scott,"Feels like you are in the woods, yet still close to town. The space was very comfortable for two.  Kyle is a great host!"
25873321,318540384,2018-09-03,208565826,Sandra,"We will definitely keep this location on our 5 star list of sites.  We were there to help family and  Kyle was always prompt with a response whenever we had a question.  He was very accommodating, I casually mentioned my husband liked dark beer, when we arrived we found a very nice 6 pack in the fridge.  The apt was nice, clean, and quiet, and we will definitely will be back."
25873321,326196320,2018-09-21,111921725,Carolyn,"Kyle deserves more than 5 stars for his beautiful AirBnb and the amenities he provides.  The property is stunning and living area is beautifully decorated and so comfortable.  I particularly appreciated the great coffee selection!!  Kyle is welcoming, thoughtful and quick to help with anything you need.  I wish I had booked a longer stay."
25873321,327951321,2018-09-24,127768436,Colby & Ashley,"While staying at this beautiful location you are truly on vacation. Kyle insists on making your stay comfortable and care free. His home was pet friendly to our two well-behaved dogs. Kyle really thought about every detail you would want and many more you didn’t even know you’d want! We felt welcome and right at home from the moment we pulled in to the driveway. Kyle was quick to respond if we needed anything. I would recommend this location to anyone. You’re close enough to town to run to the store or park, but, when you’re “at home” it’s easy to forget that you’re not tucked away peacefully in the woods. There is a lot of “Oregon Charm” in the home and we can’t wait to stay again!"
25873321,328999893,2018-09-27,21369569,Melissa,"Kyle’s place is immaculate. Every attention to detail has been met. I cannot express how accommodating, kind and flexible Kyle was, in regards to my stay and my needs. This place is an incredible value."

Spacious living room/dining area,  separate bedroom and bathroom...all beautifully appointed.  Kyle went out of his way to make our weekend very special.  It's a ""must do"" if you are exploring the area."
25873321,459785607,2019-05-27,4759145,Joanne,"Impeccably clean, very spacious and extremely comfortable. Loved all the vintage cameras and the electric ""wood-burning"" stove. Kyle's place is both cozy and charming and a really great retreat for relaxing after a long day visiting with family. Tucked into the trees with deer roaming out front yet just a few minutes from downtown. Even though it's on the bottom floor underneath the main part of the house, it is incredibly quiet and private. We would come back here in a heartbeat next time we're in town!"

25873321,481988056,2019-07-05,14982477,Terri,"Kyles place was awesome!! So clean, decorated up to date and Kyle was so thoughtful with it being my husband and I’s 25th anniversary.  He made sure everything was perfect for us.  Kyle has great recommendations of wineries.  Definitely will stay here again if we’re in the area."
25873321,485375082,2019-07-10,21132444,Molly,"Kyle's place was wonderful to stay at!  We had everything we needed, plus many thoughtful touches that were much appreciated (e.g., preferred beverages provided after Kyle inquired).  We would recommend his place to others and likely stay again!"
25873321,497654310,2019-07-28,96079301,Shirley,"Kyle has set the bar high for those wishing to be super hosts. He is a genuinely nice man and he has made may thoughtful  touches to his beautiful place and keeps improving it--he added beautiful flower boxes to the guest's outside space while we were there.  It's tucked in the woods so the deer, chipmunks and squirrels were frequent sights, but still close to town. We highly recommend staying at this very special AirBnB."
25873321,513671163,2019-08-19,40795112,Vivian,Excellent property! Great place to unwind and be treated like a super guest
25873321,515273550,2019-08-22,76001837,Lea,Beautiful inside and out! Plenty of space—a really quiet getaway.
25873321,519045746,2019-08-27,35566623,Monte,"Kyle far exceeds the definition of super host. His thoughtfulness, extreme attention to detail and wonderful location made it hard to leave when the time came.  We will be back.  Five stars all around. Thanks Kyle!"
25873321,522996526,2019-09-02,114627706,Suzanne,"Kyle is the consummate host, and his place is the perfect hideaway for a couple wishing to spend time in South Salem.  The mini-apartment is situated in a woodsy area, is quite spacious and comfortable, and it’s nicely decorated.  Bonus—it’s pet-friendly, too!  It was the perfect place for us; we wanted to eat breakfast in but had no desire to cook lunch and dinner at the apartment.  The hot plate provided sufficed just fine for us.  The bathroom is spacious and beautifully decorated.  Kyle thought of everything, even down to the beer in the fridge and the bottle of Pinot Noir on the table.

One last note:  Most. Comfy. Bed. Ever."
25873321,533527518,2019-09-21,284236925,Connie,"Lovely secluded house, still very close to Salem. Plenty of space, special decor selections, pet friendly!"

25873321,547213926,2019-10-14,288407076,Shelly,Thank you! Amazinging trip!
25873321,550346836,2019-10-18,79254292,Olivia,"If I could give Kyle’s place an infinite number of stars, I would! The guest suite was super stylish, homey, and had every thing I needed. The entire property is beautiful, and it’s in an amazing neighborhood. 

Kyle is an amazing host as well. Super polite and accommodating, and left me with coffee and wine to enjoy during my stay! He is great at communicating with his guests, responds quickly. I even managed to lock myself out one night and he quickly got my text/call and let me in with no frustration, even though I know it was a pain. 

I would stay here a hundred times more!"
25873321,552907943,2019-10-22,253666630,Jazmin,"Kyle's place is in a scenic quiet area. Amazing space to stay in, anything and everything that was thought of to make it cozy and relaxing."
25873321,563698521,2019-11-13,79109786,Laura,"A peaceful  and quiet location.  Kyle is an attentive host and most accommodating .  AT&T service not so good, even with Kyle generous sharing fo his WiFi booster"
25873321,567906160,2019-11-23,201134476,Anthony,Great place in a great location! Kyle went above and beyond!! I would highly recommend this stay!
25873321,569493055,2019-11-26,58509757,Regina,"We were landing super late in Portland, thus arriving at ~2 am to Salem. Kyle made accommodations, which included even making a bed for my son (@sofa-bed)!
I felt that he was the kindest host I ever experienced at Airbnb...
The property was very well lit and easy to find at night; quiet, but still close to Salem..."
25873321,579462485,2019-12-20,138433163,Jennifer,"Kyle's Antlerwood Hollow provides a calm and peaceful setting for a weekend getaway, a staycation, or in my case a longer-term transitional residence as I moved cross-country to Oregon from Texas. This hidden gem is nestled amongst beautiful trees, hills, and winding roads and offers frequent sightings of deer. The place is sparkling clean, stylishly decorated, pet-friendly with approval, and minutes from restaurants and shops. It's easy to find and equipped with every amenity you could possibly need or want. Kyle has a delightful personality and energy and he ensures the comfort of his guests. He's very responsive and attentive to messages and needs. He even won over my sweet but skeptical pup. I would highly recommend a visit to Antlerwood Hollow. You'd think after 3 weeks there I wouldn't want to go back for a while, but I would certainly stay again for a weekend getaway or staycation."
25873321,581028879,2019-12-23,8498648,Kendra,"Kyle's place was perfect for my family to spend a couple of nights. The living area is spacious enough to hang out and play games, with a fold out couch and extra mattresses. There are plenty of amenities: parking, good lighting, Alexa for communication and music, even several options for making coffee. The location is better than expected, five minutes from restaurants in South Salem and near downtown as well. We would definitely stay again."
25873321,585389306,2019-12-31,210387770,Sheri,"Kyle’s place was amazing! Best Airbnb and better than any hotel we’ve ever stayed in! Every amenity was perfect and so many personal touches! We visit our family in Salem often, so I hope this place will be available each trip. The scenic trail behind the house is beautiful and was perfect to take our young grandsons on. Can’t say enough good things about Antlerwood! Thank you, Kyle!"
25873321,619514452,2020-03-17,148594369,Katrina,Clean and perfectly decorated space! Host was very quick with responding and accommodating!
25873321,627867197,2020-06-05,232473655,Shawn,"What an amazing little hidden paradise. Probably the nicest, cleanest, and best neighborhood around. Kyle will go out of his way to make sure you have everything you want. Deer and birds daily, chipmunk and rabbit too, say hello to my Stellar Jays while you’re there, I know they miss me."
25873321,629321923,2020-06-13,209812163,Christi,Kyle’s place was a wonderful and relaxing place to stay. He had a warm welcome waiting for us. His place is beautiful and was very clean. We enjoyed the beautiful and peaceful settings.
25873321,629760790,2020-06-14,2573813,Julia,I wish I could give 20 stars! Kyle's place was super clean and comfortable with thoughtful touches all over the place - including a personalized sign welcoming us and our dog by name! The space is well designed and stocked with everything one could possibly need. Kyle was extremely easy to communicate with and helped recommend a great place to go hiking. We are really looking forward to the next opportunity we have to take a trip down to Salem so that we can stay at Kyle's place again!
25873321,631314375,2020-06-21,25681,Laura,"Well decorated, spacious and good location. Hot water and water pressure was great. Loved the bed, so comfortable and nice bedding!!!

Heater stove in living area and portable heater fan in bedroom. 

Washer and dryer worked well and nice to have access to. 

Beer in fridge but I don’t drink beer so I didn’t partake but nice touch. There were many coffee choices as well. 

Quiet downstairs unit. There are two steps up and over to go from living room to bedroom. Sink in bathroom or utility room, none in the kitchen just as advertised.

First day was warm so Kyle turned on AC so the Airbnb unit could cool down. Unit does not have its own control of temperature/AC.

As mentioned, AT&T service is not the greatest in the unit."
25873321,632355902,2020-06-26,98017460,Claudia,"Peace, a little heaven, relax... amazing place... near the city but out..."
25873321,633418329,2020-06-29,197421231,Jenner,Kyle is very thoughtful and accommodating and the suite is extremely clean and in a beautiful location.
25873321,635545736,2020-07-06,276839233,Marsha,"We typically don't stay in ""shared space"" airbnb's.  Don't miss this rustic, chic space for that reason! Kyle's place was comfortable and inviting and he was available by a simple text when we asked questions.  The coffee was amazing, with a touch of espresso! Kyle even had a case of water waiting for us when we arrived.   There was plenty of room for my husband and I.  We ate breakfast in and ate dinner at restaurants in town that Kyle suggested.  We were not disappointed.  Don't pass up this gem."
25873321,636573771,2020-07-10,58472629,Rene,This is a great find. Kyle thought of everything. Very comfortable stay!

25873321,639103363,2020-07-17,70005534,April,"This suite was perfect for our stay in Salem. The space was comfortable and clean, and the property is absolutely beautiful while still being accessible to a lot in Salem. Kyle was very welcoming and hospitable."
25873321,639523703,2020-07-18,113436813,Delaney,"Space was great! Lots of privacy despite being a “shared” space - barely! Loves that dogs are welcomed, great outdoor space, great bathroom supplies and had local beer for us in the fridge."
25873321,640581910,2020-07-20,331569944,Dodi,Kyle has a wonderful place to relax...a great assortment of movies..nice computer table...extremely comfortable bed with soft pillows...a dual head shower with nice soft towels...the place also has multiple sitting areas and hammocks where you can relax and take in nature...will definitely return
25873321,653950000,2020-08-20,100262186,Portia,"This stay was INCREDIBLE! Kyle treated both myself and my dogs like family. I couldn’t ask for more. His AirBNB was beautiful and incredibly cozy. All the amenities you could imagine and MORE! Sweet touches like beer in the fridge and coffee for the morning! 

The surrounding woods and wildlife were magical. We saw deer multiple times, rabbits, squirrels, the works.

Kyle went above and beyond for us and I’ll feel forever grateful. When the California fires were raging and I needed a few more days to crash, Kyle was more than willing to help me out.

This stay will wow you beyond belief, no matter what your expectations are. Adult friendly, kid friendly, and dog friendly :) Enjoy yourself!"
27631253,307134931,2018-08-13,15978243,Stormy And Conor,"Carly's place is in a great established neighborhood in Salem. She's got a nice back patio to hang out on, and a wonderful collection of flowers throughout the yard. She's got a wealth of local knowledge on weekend events, and is an incredibly warm and friendly person. "

27631253,312580950,2018-08-23,211201057,Paul,"Very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Very close to the fairgrounds. Easy access to the main road to the northeast, and quick drive west to the main north/south roads of Keizer & Salem.  I would use again during my stays in the area."
27631253,314432356,2018-08-26,13670171,Cathy,"Carly's place is everything she promised and more. Very warm and welcoming. We loved the fresh cut sunflowers! And the bed was very comfy. The patio and backyard is such a beautiful space, and because we were there to visit the state fair, we got to enjoy the sounds of carnival-goers and watch the nightly fireworks display with a glass of wine on the swing. With just a 7 minute walk to the main entrance of the fairgrounds, Carly's place is ideally located."
27631253,318539526,2018-09-03,175727162,Alison,"Great place to stay- so cute, good location and lots of thoughtful touches. Carly also has amazing suggestions for local restaurants and wineries. Very easy check in."

27631253,338532335,2018-10-19,41652405,Carlos Enrique,"Great, cute space with lots of mindful, considerate details. The cottage has its own mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker, with coffee and several types of tea to choose from. It serves a basic purpose if you are in Salem on vacation, to visit the area. The Internet is spotty about half of the time, with a very weak signal, which can be frustrating if you have things to get done online. Other than that, I enjoyed the space greatly, it was very clean, well located, with parking right outside your door, and a cute, well-equipped bathroom."
27631253,339553041,2018-10-21,216753577,Rachel,"Cute place which is a great location to crash for a night. Microwave, fridge and minor kitchen utensils supplied. Even wine and beers! Bed is comfy and bathroom is clean. Host is great at communication."

27631253,341391288,2018-10-26,112949219,Julia,"Carly's place is amazing! it is so cute, really easy to check in and has some really homey touches that I thought were wonderful! Oneof the best airbnbs I've stayed at."

27631253,344503895,2018-11-03,7986229,Brianne,"Carly's place was convenient, quiet, and clean. We loved that we could park right in front of our door and the check-in couldn't have been easier. She graciously left wine in the room, although we didn't partake, and the bed was quite comfortable. We'd stay with her again if we were in the area."

27631253,358538242,2018-12-14,7044348,Moonrose,"Carly was so thoughtful and provided coffee, tea, fruit, and granola bars. The place was very clean, cozy, and decorated nicely. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was bright and airy. Parking right in front was perfect. Loved that there was a small fridge with freezer. The best thing though was the filtered water in glass jars. I'm very opposed to plastic and disposables, so this was wonderful."
27631253,361499051,2018-12-23,221195006,Debra,Very nice place to stay.
27631253,363469638,2018-12-28,79505210,Ann,"Cozy, clean, and stylish room! Carly sent a message when I was on my way with everything I needed to know (where to find the key, where the WiFi password is, etc). She had multiple treats, cookies, and even wine set out for us. The room is private, but you can at times hear others on the other side of the wall (though they were never that loud). Great stay!"

27631253,416535775,2019-02-24,232015223,Bo,"Stylish bungalow with private entrance, and off-street parking. Carly was prompt to respond to my questions and thoroughly detailed the check-in process. The room was fully loaded with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, an abundance of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, a fruit bowl, and plenty of towels, and toiletries in bathroom. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and close to the events my friends and I were in town to attend.
Would certainly stay here again."

Easy access off of I5, and close to all the things, yet nice and quiet. The place is sparkling clean, the bed is super comfy, and so many little touches made us feel right at home ( drinks, coffee, fresh fruit, granola bars ). Will definitely look to stay here again when we are in Salem next."
27631253,427468031,2019-03-23,3867066,Leeann,Aesthetic. Cozy. Comfortable. They provided every necessity. It was like a tiny house. It's always great to have self check-in.

 We came to do a show at the fairgrounds, and so all we needed was a small room & bathroom.. but everything extra made us feel right at home. Will definitely book again!"
27631253,439802305,2019-04-19,13281397,Nyla,"This is a cozy little nook. Carly provides nice touches for her travelers, the jug of water was particularly appreciated. I slept well and felt safe and secure."
27631253,440360834,2019-04-20,255481435,Ian,"Would highly recommend. We checked in late, and the host was prepared with a message on instructions to get in, the lights where on, and the curtain was open in the room leading us to a wonderful private room. We had everything we needed there: a bathroom w/shower, drinks, glasses, and other items that were for our use, and a clean bed, a cozy space, and all the fine touches of a memorable evening. Easy street parking in a quiet neighborhood and the host was very kind and efficient about getting back to me. Great experience front to back."

27631253,459055932,2019-05-26,60566034,Margaret,"Carly’s cottage bungalow was just perfect for an overnight stay in Salem. Such a cozy room, with a small bath (with a classic tile shower) and an outdoor patio area. The place was nicely decorated and well stocked with snacks, coffee, teas, hot cocoa and even wine. I loved the warm blanket from Portugal, a very nice touch of comfort. We were within walking distance of LB Day Amphitheater, where we attended a concert. It was a rainy day and night so we didn’t get to use the patio area, but it sure was a peaceful setting. I would happily stay there again should my travels take me to Salem."
27631253,459835068,2019-05-27,109665712,Allexa,"Carly’s place was a nice spot for us to sleep during our road trip up to the PNW. It was a little less private than we expected as the walls are very thin and we could hear everything going on in the house. But other than that it was clean, the bed was comfy, and it was a quiet neighborhood so it was just what we needed for a night of rest during our travels."
27631253,463173603,2019-06-02,33736113,Richa,"Carly's place is amazing! It is private, great amenities and touches, clean and conveniently located. The porch in the back was a delight for breakfasts and hanging out in the evening. Highly recommended!"

27631253,475125067,2019-06-23,30252126,Elizabeth,"Carly’s place was so cute and quaint. Like other reviewers, I gotta say Carly really goes all out with the little touches and though it’s a small space, it has all you need for a good stay! Carly was a good communicator and my boyfriend and I enjoyed our time there. The only minor issue is the walls are a bit thin which woke us up one morning but all in all, I give this a 5 star review and would stay again. Thank you, Carly!"

Her place was very clean and she provided a few nice little ""extras"" that I wasn't expecting at all. Bed was very comfortable and we both slept like rocks!  The outside space was perfect.  Beautiful flowers and a cute little hummingbird that came by every once in awhile.  So nice to hang out in and have morning coffee or to relax in the afternoon before going out to dinner.  I'd highly recommend staying with her when you visit Salem."

The artwork is inspiring, the perfectly imperfect garden with a hammock, butterflies/bees/hummingbirds during the spring and summer season. Chris is an AMAZING teacher and puts Dutch Bros and Starbucks to shame. Rita is a beautiful, level-headed Crochet Queen with nothing but the wisest words to share. I'm so incredibly grateful for my time there. I'll never forget it! Also, the neighborhood is very safe. I loved taking walks around there."

Our host is a great with communication and the home is located near a Walmart and Safeway. The neighborhood is nice and we felt very safe staying there. We will diffidently plan another trip with Tammy!"
29382038,344485648,2018-11-03,58202916,Brenda,"Tammy’s airbnb space is one of our favorites we have visited.  There were just two of us, but it would have been quite comfortable for 6.  From the moment we walked in late Friday evening, we were wowed by the totally refurbished home.  The entire house has been stylishly decorated and decked out with beautiful new furniture and decor.  The linens are not only beautiful, but also very high quality and comfortable.  Although we did not really cook, we were thrilled to find plentiful supplies to prepare our own breakfast.  Although the house backs up to a busier street, the new windows kept the house very quiet.  Tammy was easy to work with and she went out of her way to make sure our stay was just perfect.  We are in Salem often and hope to stay at Tammy’s place again soon."

29382038,352125539,2018-11-24,54076899,Jerry,This was wonderful place to stay. The house was clean and it genuinely felt like a home away from home. You won't find a better host than Tammy.  I would not hesitate to stay here again. I highly recommend this place for your next stay.

It felt like we were staying in a home meant for a magazine. Wonderful amenities and so many thoughtful touches. You will not be disappointed with your stay here. It is tucked into a nice, safe neighborhood across from a large park. Not too far from restaurants and things to see in Salem.  100% would stay again. Thanks, Tammy!"
29382038,355561197,2018-12-04,110726517,Sally,"This house is a gem!  I've rented many airbnb and (Hidden by Airbnb) and this was by far the nicest place we've stayed.  Everything was news, clean, and homey.  It's a convenient location, Tammy is quick to respond to questions.  I will stay there again for sure!"
29382038,357282161,2018-12-09,75024632,Ken,"We stayed with our son and his wife at Tammy's B&B rather than in a hotel, and we were SOOO glad we did!   She has made this house into a LOVELY home. The pictures do not lie. The beds were really comfortable, and I am very picky about that. The kitchen had yogurt, granola bars, hot cocoa, and coffee. It was all so clean and fresh! You will be glad you chose this B&B!"
29382038,359415121,2018-12-16,19961512,Paula,"The house is spacious and comfortable.  Very clean, everything works, many nice touches--such as a decorated Christmas tree, candies, bread and yogurt."

We had plenty of room for two couples with an additional room that when we visit Salem again, the kids could share. She even had a beautiful Christmas tree to enjoy. Location was great! Our group give Tammy's place five stars in every category!"
29382038,366508257,2019-01-02,135332131,Michelle,"Tammy's Place is wonderful. It was extremely clean and the amenities were great and made our stay so great. Tammy is amazing! She was very accommodating to all our needs and quick to respond to all our questions. She even went the extra mile and put up a Christmas tree, that was decorated beautifully I might add, to make our holiday vacation so special. Traveling all the way from Hawaii we felt right at home in Tammy's Place. We will be definitely be staying here again.  Mahalo Tammy for everything."
29382038,401102324,2019-01-13,103351676,Pamela,"Tammy's place is a beautifully decorated and remodeled ""home"". Centrally located near shopping, parks and the city center.  Communication with Tammy was quick and informative and check-in was easy! The extra touches such as the yogurt in the fridge, granola bars, microwave popcorn, coffee and hot cocoa were very much appreciated.
     On a personal side, I originally rented Tammy's place so my family and siblings could have a place to spend time together with my ailing Mother. Sadly, my Mother passed before our stay so it became the place my family gathered to share stories & memories, to laugh and cry and to celebrate her life. We all felt very comfortable and at ""home""  in Tammy's place.    We can't thank her enough for our stay and she will forever be a part of our story. I would highly recommend Tammy's place to anyone looking to stay in the Salem area.
*On a side (Website hidden by Airbnb) family could not stop raving about how amazingly soft and fluffy the towels were!!!!  :D lol"
29382038,406208464,2019-01-28,123452495,Gabriel,"This is the perfect place to stay if you are in the Salem Oregon area! Super clean, warm and cozy and feels like a home away from home. Just a few minutes from the freeway and a quick shot up to Portland. 5 stars"
29382038,411515442,2019-02-12,88412371,Duke & Kelly,"Tastefully remodeled with super comfortable beds. Dream refrigerator/freezer and five-burner cooktop. There's a good variety of K-cups for the coffee machine, teas, and cocoa mixes. Tammy provided fresh fruits, snacks, and yogurt plus a few boxed items and spices.  Easy keypad entry and privacy. The home backs up to a busy main street elevated above the back fence. Ask Tammy whether the front and back lawn and landscaping have been completed yet."

Appreciate the attention to detail throughout including nice towels and a good array of kitchen utensils and cookware. Loved the coded entry (Website hidden by Airbnb) keys to keep track of. 

Tammy was very responsive and checked in with us to make sure we got in and everything was as expected. Any expectations were clearly articulated and very reasonable."
29382038,430110084,2019-03-29,242602491,Alexandria,"Tammy's house felt like a home. It was clean, cozy and inviting. She thought of everything! After traveling 20 hours from Colorado, it was so refreshing to stay in an actual house. The beds were amazing, as were the showers. We also appreciated the decor, as well as the little things Tammy provided us with, like the fresh fruit and yogurt. She went above and beyond to ensure a quality, relaxing stay in Salem. We were very pleased. The one thing I will say we wished for after a long day on the Pacific Coast: access to a washer and dryer! We stayed in Salem for a whole week, so being able to wash our clothes would've been a plus, but overall, our stay at Tammy's was more than we could've asked for."
29382038,431403972,2019-03-31,44438964,Rachelle,"Beautiful, comfortable home tastefully decorated. Centrally located with easy access to everything."

29382038,435209861,2019-04-09,87395010,Don-Vicki,Tammy's house is exceptionally clean. She kept in touch with us as we came into town and when we left. The house was beautifully decorated and even had Easter treats out along with fruit and yogurt in the fridge that we enjoyed at breakfast. It's a great place for a respite.

29382038,445113926,2019-04-28,114841702,Katie,"Tammy's place was spotless and full on amenities.  She provided everything we needed for our family of 6 for our 2-night stay. She left special touches like chocolates in the rooms and cookie dough to bake in the freezer. It is obvious that Tammy works hard to take special care of her guests and make sure that they are blessed by their stay at her home. I especially appreciated the washer and dryer and Oodles of fluffy white towels. The house is located perfectly for families who want to explore Salem and there's a park down the road. The front and backyard are currently being prepared for new landscaping due to some down trees, but it had no impact on our stay. We were happy to have Tammy's house as a respite during our busy visit. Thanks Tammy"
29382038,448885688,2019-05-05,87395010,Don-Vicki,This was our second stay at Tammy's place within a month's time. The first time we were surprised at how wonderful the home was at a great price. The location was perfect for our needs - watching a golf tournament then attending our son's graduation this second time here.  Tammy helped make our experience in Salem a wonderful one.
29382038,450978389,2019-05-10,28237677,Autumn,"Wow! My stay was incredible! I felt like I was home. The bed was so comfortable and the thoughtful touches of yogurt and fruit were so helpful when I was out the door quickly to work. The towels are fluffy and I felt like I was staying at a 5 star resort, minus the beachfront. Thanks, Tammy!"
29382038,453742651,2019-05-16,1749907,David,Great place. Easy communication. Absolutely clean and with all that you require for your stay.
29382038,457284329,2019-05-23,28237677,Autumn,This was yet another wonderful stay with Tammy. I stay here every time I am in town for work and she never fails to delight and make my stay a true home away from home.

29382038,475794426,2019-06-24,230044287,Renee,Very comfortable home and great location for getting around! We especially loved the park/playground within walking distance across the street. Would definitely stay here again!

29382038,494132536,2019-07-23,16429396,Ross,"Tammy's place was a home with lovely facilities, perfect for the 5 adults who stayed. A large fridge, plenty of hot water, access to laundry room (not always allowed) and small additional items that certainly helped our 10 day stay. The neighbourhood was very pleasant, the street was quiet and close to a park. Shopping and restaurants were a close drive away.
Tammy herself was available and very helpful despite a  health issue in her family that occurred just before our arrival.
In all a wonderful place to stay. Thank you Tammy"
29382038,495241048,2019-07-25,272582436,Karla,This was our first Airbnb experience it was great. The whole house was so nice. Tammy was so friendly and helpful. If we ever stay in Salem again I definitely want to stay here. Close to so many things and a great neighborhood.

The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The home was conveniently located near the Vineyard we attended a wedding and festivities at. We had a great stay!

29382038,528813668,2019-09-13,184678663,Thomas,"Having stayed in several AirBnbs recently, I can say this is the best I have experienced.  The house is located in a quite neighborhood with relatively convenient access to downtown Salem (Restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, etc.) We stopped in on our way from California to Washington to check out the Willamette Valley Wineries.  We visited a couple wineries that were within an hour's drive from the house.  It appears that the house had recently been remodeled.  Most of the appliances and furniture also appears new.  Both beds were comfortable and with two full baths, there was no conflict at shower time.  I'd highly recommend this location."
29382038,531501285,2019-09-17,113271829,Melanie,We had a wonderful stay at Tammy's home in Salem for our daughters wedding.  It was perfect for our family to be together and share in the celebration.  Having a big beautifully decorated home with a stocked kitchen made it so comfortable for everyone.  The bedrooms and bathrooms were very well decorated and spacious too.  Thanks again and I would definitely recommend this home!!

29382038,566550127,2019-11-19,294770373,Holly,Nice family neighborhood with extra special and thoughtful amenities. Very clean and met all expectations. Couldn’t be happier for our first BNB experience.
29382038,569465186,2019-11-26,144177123,Quincy,"A great home away from home! This house was a perfect home base for our family of 5 for 7 days.  The house is updated and feels very new and contemporary. It’s styled very similar to our own home, adding to our comfort level. Kitchen was beautiful, dishes were great, couch was super comfy, open floor plan was welcoming, all 4 beds were very comfortable, rooms were nicely decorated, and plenty of basic amenities to get us going (soap, shampoo, etc). While the house is not officially “kid proof,” we did find it very kid friendly (all we had to do was move a few delicate items and the house was “safe” even for our 1-yr old). It’s also great having a nice park right across the street. TV is a smart tv so we could watch Netflix, etc. Would have loved to use the washer and dryer, but I understand why that is not always available in an AirBNB. We survived. Also, as noted by others, the pillows and comforters are down, so keep that in mind if you have allergies. It was not an issue for us. 

All in all, this was the best option we found in Salem for a comfortable 3-bedroom home that was a WAY better value than getting 2 hotel rooms. We would definitely stay at Tammy’s house again and would recommend it 100% to everyone else. Thanks!"
29382038,571110779,2019-11-30,257437227,Randy,We had a great time in Salem while visiting family for Thanksgiving. The space was so beautifully appointed and cozy and made us feel right at home. There were thoughtful touches like fresh fruit in the kitchen and spare toiletries just in case you forget something. The house is in a very quiet neighborhood and is right across from a park. Would definitely stay again!
29382038,576213822,2019-12-12,292085695,Tiffany,Very clean and well kept home. Lots of little stuff that she leaves for guests use. Her decor gave a very homey feeling. Also she decorated a christmas tree for us. We were thankful to have such a kind and caring host. Will stay here again and recommend to friends and family. Thank you again tammy.
29382038,577629016,2019-12-15,241341021,Michelle,We really enjoyed our stay. Having a Christmas Tree all decorated for us to enjoy was an extra special treat. The location is perfect near shopping and dining. Our family was very comfortable and it truly felt like a home away from home.

29382038,584870582,2019-12-30,319652712,Alex,"Had an awesome time at this location, was very clean, communication was quick and helpful. For sure a 5 out of 5"
29382038,593043131,2020-01-14,71877618,Arielle,"Tammy’s home is absolutely wonderful.  I have had the delight of staying here two times in the last few months, and it is truly a home away from home.  The beds are amazingly comfortable, even the couch is so comfy, I took a picture of the tag so I can find one just like it when I go home.  It’s immaculately maintained, Tammy is responsive, and the personal and thoughtful touches of things like spare floss and tums (ack! How could I forget to bring those!) make it one of my absolute favorite homes I’ve ever stayed in."
29382038,594538043,2020-01-18,20420333,Kaäre,"Clean, well appointed and thoughtful space.  Check in was a total breeze.  She also had coffee and fresh fruit waiting."
29382038,595740754,2020-01-20,157983501,Chris,"Tammy is a great host. I had some questions prior to our stay and she answered quickly and was very accommodating.

The home itself is very comfortable and clean. The kitchen was great! We typically cook during our stays and Tammy's kitchen is one of the most well appointed we have encountered. There is everything you need to make whatever you want.

The location of the home is in a quiet cul de sac. It was nice to be off the beaten path, yet within minutes of shopping, restaurants, or anything you may need. A block away is a nice city park for walking or family outings.

We very much enjoyed our stay and fully intend on staying again! We fully recommend if you are looking for a home away from home!"
29382038,598252873,2020-01-26,28600015,Micki,Tammy provides a wonderful spot to relax and gather with loved ones.
29382038,601583820,2020-02-03,33030158,Sandy,"I cannot say enough good things about Tammy's home!   It is by far the best Airbnb I've stayed at.  The photos were spot on....her home looked exactly like the pics...actually even better.   Tammy's home was clean, modern, the furniture was comfy (we decided to stay in and watch the Superbowl instead of hanging out at a noisy sports bar), stocked full of dishes, utensils, pots, pans, glasses, condiments, fresh fruit, coffee and more.  The linens were pretty, the towels fluffy and soft (not to mention they're stark white!), beds are comfy, lots of hot water; she even provides ample bath gel, shampoo, even advil, cold medicine, etc.  I've yet to see this at other Airbnbs. 

I'm not sure how often I'll find myself in Salem, OR again, but you can bet I will stay at Tammy's home if it's available...I'd likly even plan my trip around availability.

Thank you for being an awesome host!"

Tammy goes to a lot of effort to make things comfortable, clean, and homey. She also goes the extra mile by having conveniences on hand such as fresh fruit, extra fans, extra blankets, and a kitchen with everything a person would need.  It’s a quiet and safe neighborhood. Thank you, Tammy!!!!"

This home was absolutely perfect for us!  Tammy is such a gracious host.  This home is beautiful and very clean!  The kitchen was amazing and well stocked with everything we needed. Plus there were special touches like fresh fruit and yogurt, and lots of choices of coffee.  The furniture was comfortable for all of us to sit and visit.  Comfortable beds, soft towels... I could go on and on!  We would love to stay here again someday.  Thank you so much, Tammy!!"
29382038,619521507,2020-03-17,6931357,Rachel,"Amazing home, very clean and inviting. She went above and beyond and even left some fresh fruit and amazing welcoming touches."
29382038,621608240,2020-04-02,144177123,Quincy,Our second time staying here and it was a reminder that this is one of the nicest AIRBNB’s we’ve stayed in over the years. We liked her remodeling choices so much that we are doing some of the same things in our house. Great home. You won’t be disappointed.
29382038,622760176,2020-04-19,338775516,Steph,The house was beautiful and the years was as well.  Felt like being at home!!!! It was clean and everything we needed was there!!!!! I would definitely come back and stay again.  My daughter didn’t wanna leave.
29382038,624482260,2020-05-10,17733499,Kelly,"Tammy's place is wonderful! Spotless, cozy, stylish, great beds, great kitchen and dining/living area. Kitchen was well stocked. If you will be in Salem you should definitely stay here rather than in a hotel!"
29382038,627112267,2020-05-31,273982909,Julie,Tammys place was very homey. It was close to everything
29382038,631302937,2020-06-21,166849886,Mike,The house is great! The host communications were the best of any previous Airbnb’s we’ve been to. Close to everything and great for families! More than 5 stars on every aspect of our experience.
29382038,632363048,2020-06-26,170285129,Lupe,Our host Tammy was great and made us feel welcomed and comfortable.
29382038,633152015,2020-06-28,17733499,Kelly,"This was our second visit and we intend to keep coming back. Tammy's place is ideally located in a quiet neighborhood in Salem but near to downtown and good restaurants and shopping centers if needed. The beds are super comfy, like nests, and everything is very clean and sparkling new. The layout is great for a small family since there are three bedrooms. The kitchen, dining, and living room are a very nice space to hang out in."
29382038,633865654,2020-07-01,79553059,Shirley,"We loved our stay at Tammy's wonderful house...beautifully decorated, comfortable and nicely appointed. Highly recommend!"
29382038,636253210,2020-07-09,352428455,Vanessa,Great location for going out!
29382038,637560195,2020-07-12,148631882,Samantha,Thanks for being such a great host
29382038,638233336,2020-07-14,94891067,Isaac,"Tammy's place was inviting, beautiful, and clean.  We hope to stay there again the next time we visit."
29382038,638789475,2020-07-16,14648132,Maya,"Lovely place, super clean, comfortable beds! Great communication with the host. Stylish and great location. Thanks for a great stay!"
29382038,643715509,2020-07-28,206512847,Amanda,Second time staying with Tammy.  House is always clean and has everything we need.
29382038,646044816,2020-08-02,166786564,Doug,"Clean, stylish house hosted by a very nice and responsive owner.  Would recommend highly if you're in the area."
29382038,649143135,2020-08-09,74530216,Lorraine,"The home is welcoming and lovely! Makes for a great ""home base"" with a family-centered trip and a bonus to have the amazing park just across the street. Clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. Tammy was a fantastic host as well."
29382038,651067325,2020-08-14,36052192,Dani,Great location in Salem.. very cute house and Tammy was so great to work with!
29382038,652461396,2020-08-16,71871724,Tara,Had a wonderful time staying the weekend at this lovely home. We came into town for a friends wedding reception and we had plenty of room to spread out in this stylish yet cozy home. So glad there was AC as the weather was over 100 during our stay! My daughter loved the park that’s right across the stress and we enjoyed walking to use the play equipment each morning. There were some nice additional touches like ibuprofen and make up wipes if you happen to forget them. My only wish for this property would be for there to be outdoor furniture on the small deck in the backyard. We would have loved to enjoy our morning coffee outside in the sun or end our day on the deck.
29382038,655678397,2020-08-23,62109475,Leydy,"We had a great stay at Tammy's. Tammy's place was super clean and the beds were very comfortable. The home is in a perfect location if you are trying to make it to the cost, wine country and some of the national forests in one trip (not super closer but it does allow you to make it work). It is in a cute, quiet neighborhood close to supermarkets, etc. Tammy is also quite lovely, very responsive and leaves little ""extras"" for guests - all of which we appreciated. Overall this was a great choice."
29382038,659172864,2020-08-31,165709624,Tierney,Tammy responded quickly to our inquiries. Her home is very clean and enjoyable to use as a dwelling. There are also many places of establishment available in the area.
29382038,664462235,2020-09-14,266060670,Bartley,Tammy's place was very clean and nicely equipped with all the items we come to expect in an Airbnb property. Location is good and convenient to almost anything you would need. We will  definitely check availability of Tammy's place next time we are in Salem.
29382038,666912718,2020-09-21,335950608,Caitlin,WOW! Beautiful home in a very nice neighborhood. House was extremely clean and the updates are simply stunning. My in-laws stayed here for the week of our wedding and were blown away. You can tell that Tammy takes a lot of pride in her rental and we will definitely stay here the next time we are all in town again.
29382038,669221472,2020-09-28,350018277,Robert,"Tammy's place was clean and inviting. As we were in town for a funeral, I really appreciated that Tammy only contacted us once, to make sure we were ok."
29382038,671649452,2020-10-05,251206502,Alyssa,"Was my first air b&b experience & it was good. Tammy, the host, was very nice & communicated quickly. The linens & towels were soft yet crisp and smelled amazing. Great value for the space and location."
29382038,673634165,2020-10-11,230243391,Tana,"Beautiful home, Tammy was super nice when I had questions and responded pretty quickly. Everything was actually pretty close to the home."
29730707,348145155,2018-11-12,224527385,Brianna,"Had an amazing stay, very clean, 1 or 2 parks about 5 minutes down the road, a bunch of restaurants near by, Carly was very pleasant!"
29730707,416616064,2019-02-24,92727880,Brenda,We really enjoyed staying with Carly! We loved the tastefully decorated suite and had plenty of room. Very clean and cozy. Parking was very convenient and checkin was super smooth. Wonderful location and we will definitely try to stay here on future trips to this area.
29730707,418272836,2019-03-01,104235294,David,"Very nice place, with great attention to detail. Would definitely stay again."
29730707,665478779,2020-09-18,23048400,Javier,"I rented Carly's place for about three months. My overall experience was very good. Both Carly and her daughter were extremely responsive and always addressed any concerns or problems quickly. Some things for people to consider are its location to a gas station right next door. The apartment's location is great in terms of its proximity to downtown, shops, restaurants, the Willamette River, community parks, etc. However, having a gas station right next door does add a bit more transient traffic and general noise and activity late at night. This however may be typical for a place near downtown. You should also be comfortable with dogs. There is a friendly, although intimidating at first, pit bull on site. 

Overall I had a good experience and though it was a great value."
29730707,668836149,2020-09-27,64365510,Sarah,You wont be disappointed in this charming comfortable stay. Carley added special touches that made us smile !  I will book again when returning to salem!
30340285,355793763,2018-12-05,185958040,Jazmine,"Caleb and Keely were very gracious people. The apartment was beautiful, clean and had everything you could need. It was truly a home away from home. This made is so much easier on us during our travels and gave us a nice break to relax and not have to worry about improvising or spending extra money on eating out. Very cozy and well insulated. Great privacy and definitely one of our favorite Airbnb spots. The cleaning fee is super steep but I was able to get Airbnb to cover it so that we could save some gas money til we traveled to our next job and got paid again. Otherwise it's a great deal. The hosts were willing to waive the cleaning for us, knowing we were a little tight on money that week. I would not expect this to happen as a regular thing for customers. I just wanted to include this part of our story to show what Wonderful people they are. I didn't pay attention to the total like I should have before confirming my purchase for the night and even though they have the least restrictive possible cancellation policy, I still would have been out even more money and not be able to afford a place to stay for the night. They would've been effected negatively too, as far as bad marks on Airbnb's end and could have even been out $100 themselves with the way their policies work, had they changed or cancelled anything for us. (Which is ridiculous for them to penalize the hosts like that.) I just thought it was really great of them to offer to pay me back the $20 cleaning fee in cash, in the event that we checked out early. They did not have to do that and I was very thankful for their offer. Luckily, as I stated earlier, I was able to contact Airbnb and explain my situation to them and they covered the cleaning fee to ensure we had a positive experience with them. It isn't often that you'll find people who genuinely care and are willing to help perfect strangers. Again, please don't expect this or try to take advantage of them, just know that you'll have some amazing hosts who are good people while staying there. Definitely recommend!"
30340285,356282790,2018-12-07,174239861,Cindy,Totally recommend staying here. Plenty of little extras that made my stay a great one.
30340285,358539533,2018-12-14,228917278,Justin,"This place is far more than you expect. It's clean, modern, comfortable, quiet, and cozy. Literally the nicest place I've ever stayed while working on the road and I've been staying away from home on and off for the past 10 years."
30340285,359328071,2018-12-16,228390956,Mary,"Caleb and Keely have a clean, stylish space that is welcoming and suited with all the amenities.  We were in town for a Celebration of Life and considered the space our home away from home.  It was comfortable and Caleb was responsive and accommodating to our requests.  I recommend staying with them if you are in the Salem area!"
30340285,359716494,2018-12-17,210552902,Isabeau,Absolutely loved staying in this beautiful and stylish space. Caleb and Keely were quick at responding to messages and very accommodating. It was the perfect size space for my partner and I to enjoy a relaxing evening in front of the fire place on a rainy night. Would definitely recommend staying here!
30340285,360470383,2018-12-20,228917278,Justin,Best place I've ever stayed.
30340285,362997422,2018-12-27,227341142,Batb,Impeccably kept apartment/suite!!  Thanks for the hospitality and great communication!
30340285,364955765,2018-12-31,13081910,Alex,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay. Caleb was super cool, and welcoming. Fit four adults perfectly for a weekend. We accidentally locked ourselves out of the place and Caleb was there within a phone call to unlock the place for us. It was nice to have the coffee maker, pots, and pans and a stove to make food in the morning. I wish I could give their place more than 5 stars. Perfect, cozy, and comfortable."
30340285,441360085,2019-04-21,36066440,John,"Every once in a while you run in to a real gem - this is THAT place! Great space, great location, great value, and super clean, what else could we ask for!

Thanks guys!"
30340285,446123901,2019-04-30,239814985,Erik,Great private apartment in Salem. Super clean and lots of amenities. The apartment has more to offer than a  traditional hotel. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Caleb and Keely! Enjoyed my stay at your Airbnb!!
30340285,446565676,2019-05-01,18468232,Alyssa,"Caleb and Keely’s place is comfortable and clean! They were clear with instructions for how to get in with the keyless entry and parking, they offered restaurant suggestions, and have Netflix/Hulu/amazon on their tv. I liked being close to downtown where I had my work meetings. For being a basement, they were very quiet at night. I would definitely recommend!"
30340285,446979081,2019-05-02,59032306,Danny,This was a great place for stay in Salem. Caleb and Keely have done a great job with this space and it’s in a really nice part of the city.
30340285,448943026,2019-05-05,94874443,Larry,"Caleb and Keely’s place was exactly as advertised.  Clean well maintained and in a great location if your visiting downtown Salem or Willamette 
We enjoyed our stay."
30340285,449865153,2019-05-07,248976463,Jeana,It is very beautiful and in a quiet area.
30340285,451430474,2019-05-11,27464520,Anita,"Caleb and Keely’s apartment is exactly as pictured - cute and clean!  But pictures don’t capture all of the special touches they have added to make your stay as pleasant as possible. All we can say is, “It was our pleasure.” Thanks again."
30340285,454602302,2019-05-18,193045342,Jessica And Alena,"I was disappointed. Parking was difficult when I first arrived since other cars were occupying the spots next to the house because the hosts were having a gathering.  They were sitting at the kitchen table when I arrived and one host stared straight at me, then turned around. I never received as much as a text to acknowledge I was there or welcome me, or ask if I needed anything as I settled in. If they weren't on property looking right at me, I wouldn't hve thought this as strange. Then the noise started. Nowhere in the ad does it say you can hear upstairs noise, but you can hear it VERY CLEARLY, and after driving 8 hours, starting at 6 am, all I wanted to do was sleep... which I couldn't do. I was on the phone with my wife complaining about the noise when I got a message from the hosts apologizing for all the noise (still no welcome) I thought the timing was weird, especially for it to be the fist communication, as though my conversation had been heard while I was in my bedroom. I didn't want to deal with any drama so I decided to call airbnb the next day.  The next morning I went to shower and found ants and flies in the bathroom, both species were small but their presence at all was disappointing. When I contacted Airbnb about a resolution,  they said the host was offering me $20 and they would not refund me the cleaning fee for an unclean accomodation. The host could have avoided this true and honest review if they had played fairly. Good luck with this listing"
30340285,456107990,2019-05-20,118720540,Karen,Great location!! Looks exactly as pictures.  We were in town for our daughter's law school graduation at Willamette.  Super close to everything.  We ate out but the kitchen had the basic so we could have  cooked instead.  Would definitely stay again.
30340285,457274437,2019-05-23,257428595,Luca,"My stay was excellent, it was very clean and beautiful!"
30340285,457732593,2019-05-24,88672419,Megan,"This is a very cute place. It is clean and feels super cozy. We weren’t there long, but didn’t hear noise from above. Lots of notes describing things, like what size mug to use for the coffee maker to make sure it doesn’t spill, etc."
30340285,459083390,2019-05-26,4577139,Kelly,Perfect stay!
30340285,461041784,2019-05-30,55128798,Jamie,I was in Salem looking for an inexpensive place to sleep while visiting family. It was cozy and a really nice place to recharge! It had everything I needed and special little touches essential for long distance travel.
30340285,463167433,2019-06-02,6433364,Cass,"What a little treasure in this spot. Super comfy, meticulously clean, very warm hosts. They sure know how to make you feel at home in this stylish apartment. Loved our stay!!!!"

30340285,469507888,2019-06-14,7878977,Audrey,"Great location in a quiet residential neighborhood, with all the comforts of home.
Hosts were quick and responsive to a couple of mishaps we encountered, very much enjoyed our stay."

30340285,479223873,2019-06-30,46811832,Tyler,"Amazing space! It was in a great quiet neighborhood, and shopping or food was very accesible. Caleb and Keely were so accommodating and very quick to respond to us. Thank you for your cute touches and cleanliness as well! Will be staying here again if we come back out West!"
30340285,517871712,2019-08-25,213624901,Cheryl,"Very comfortable apartment, quite spacious, tastefully decorated.  Kitchen is nicely stocked, full size fridge and stove and small dishwasher make this very convenient for an extended stay. Bed and sofa are very comfortable and space is quite quiet.  Location is convenient to downtown and commercial areas and just a couple blocks from a large park."
30340285,577708398,2019-12-15,273313319,Meghan,Caleb and Keely's place was the perfect place for an extended trip to Salem. The location was perfect and the house was very clean. Caleb and Keely were extremely accommodating throughout the whole stay and were always available if I needed anything. I will definitely return to their place if I find myself in Salem again!
30340285,600025677,2020-01-31,284250857,Mirijam,"Wonderful apartment just as in the pictures. 
Very friendly and helpful family. 
Whenever back in Salem I would definitely choose it again."
30340285,619917216,2020-03-19,70697350,John,"Caleb and Keely's place was amazing. It was exactly as pictured, and felt even better than described! It's in the basement of their home, but it's so comfortable and cozy, it doesn't feel anything like a basement. Parking is on the side of their house. There are windows in the kitchen and bedroom, so it isn't dark and gloomy all the time. Their kitchen had everything you would need for a stay with regards to pots, pans, utensils, dishes, etc. The living room is very cozy, with an electric fireplace to make sure you stay nice and warm during the cold months. The bathroom was clean, the shower was great, and they provided everything you might need during the stay. The bedroom had a nice drawer to put your belongings with a small closet to hang your clothes. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and made it easy to fall asleep every night. Overall, Caleb and Keely's place was amazing. Everything was great, and we easily felt like home after we were able to get some groceries to stock the fridge. Overall, I would recommend people staying here whether it's for a short, or long-term stay."
30340285,623094845,2020-04-25,331050741,Jose,"The stay was amazing, perfect for a stay that allows you to get the feeling of a home without putting everything you own in a duffle bag. Great neighborhood which allowed for beautiful walks and near numerous groceries options."

30340285,650251824,2020-08-12,46725166,Devin,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Caleb and Keely's place for about two months this summer and had a great experience! We were a bit apprehensive about living in a basement, but the place is really well lit, and since it's so close to Bush Park it's easy to get outside. Also, Caleb and Keely redid the backyard while we were here, so now the backyard is a beautiful place to hang out and they were very gracious about sharing that space with us. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the utensils and cookware necessary to make just about anything. The bed and couch were very comfortable. The WiFi was fast and reliable. My girlfriend was taking an online class for the duration of our stay and never had a Zoom call drop. Caleb was always very available for any question we had, and though their family was upstairs, it was never really a bother to hear the kiddos running around. It was too bad that this summer everything was closed, because the location is really great, only about a 20 minute walk or quick drive to downtown. Overall, great little apartment for a short or long term stay!"
30442754,363469254,2018-12-28,50031596,Nathan,"Bill & Aimee really spent the time and thoughtful efforts into providing such a great, cozy, home-like experience for us. Anything we needed as far as amenities go were all provided especially items for our pup that we brought along which was a nice surprise. Glad we came across this bungalow and would definitely stay again next time we’re in town."
30442754,366542303,2019-01-02,26650994,Alison,"We enjoyed staying in the bungalow. The location is very convenient and within short walking distance to breweries, breakfast joints, and parks. The space is new, very clean, nicely decorated, and the hosts provided thoughtful touches. They were responsive and gave good tips (while respecting privacy). The fenced in yard was also a bonus. I recommend a stay!"
30442754,405866933,2019-01-27,6108887,Susan,"Great little place centrally located so everything is close.  Cozy and comfortable, the house is private and comfortable.  It's hard to find a place with an enclosed yard and it makes it so much easier to have the pup with you.  Great neighborhood to walk in."
30442754,415485652,2019-02-22,62991613,Sarah,"Aimee and Bill have done a great job of creating a private retreat with a beautiful aesthetic. This is a perfect amount of space for a couple. The neighborhood is close to amenities and downtown Salem -easy access to anything you need. We didn’t bring our dog, but this would have been an ideal set up for traveling with a pet! Thanks for a lovely stay - we will definitely come back next time we are in Salem!"

30442754,438035316,2019-04-15,91395512,Gale,Everything you could want with thoughtful extras. Bill and Aimee were always helpful if I had a question.  Really fun tiny house experience and so wonderful to have my dog with me.  Great location with so many options for eating out.  It was quiet and private with my own yard for my dog.  Great place to stay and explore Salem!
30442754,449008160,2019-05-05,224413810,Kathryn,"This place is great for a family with a young child. We put a pack-n-play in the living area and the fenced in yard is perfect for a toddler to run around. VERY clean, which is also nice for little hands that like to get into even hard to reach places to clean! A very nice stay overall."
30442754,456157278,2019-05-20,236737967,Crystal,"Quiet and comfortable. The cottage was stocked with coffee and a full sized coffee pot, plus some snacks. I would definitely stay there when visiting Salem again."
30442754,459068910,2019-05-26,8352959,Charles,"We went to Salem for the gardens.  Specifically, the iris gardens.  Bill & Aimee's place was conveniently located both the gardens and for local dining.  It was a great place to stay for a long weekend."

30442754,466890195,2019-06-09,70193857,Allison,"Aimee and Bill’s sweet cottage is the perfect home base to explore Salem. The home is located minutes from downtown and only 15 minutes from numerous wineries. There are thoughtful touches throughout like the doggie amenities, snacks, grill, extra cozy blankets and toiletries. There is a ton of privacy as well. The cottage is accessed through a separate side entrance, and there is a portion of the yard that has been fenced off from the rest of the yard. Aimee and Bill are exceptionally welcoming hosts to boot! We had a very pleasant stay."
30442754,472017332,2019-06-18,63492694,Michele,Bill and Aimee's cottage was perfect for what I needed.  It was clean and located in a quiet neighborhood
30442754,475795682,2019-06-24,16439432,Mary,"I seriously want to keep this place a secret, as it is just such a great location and they have it set up perfectly--but they had everything I needed/wanted, it is clean; and I will definitely stay again in the future!  I hadn't noticed that it was 'dog friendly', and I don't have a dog and I mentioned to them that, as a person who doesn't have dogs, I noticed that there isn't even a 'dog smell'.  So best of both worlds--as, though I'm not a 'dog person' myself, I'm glad there is a friendly place for them!  Thank you so much Bill and Aimee!"
30442754,484324748,2019-07-08,35168930,Maribel,"Perfect place for a small family! Their little home has everything you need within reach. Home is nicely organized and very modern. Only downfall was the wifi, but we only used it for the kiddos when we got back from being out all day. Thank you, we enjoyed our stay."
30442754,488284849,2019-07-14,33520512,Karen,"This place is adorable! It’s perfect for two people. There’s a small common area, a cute bedroom, and Bill and Aimee will make sure you are well taken care of!"
30442754,494136818,2019-07-23,275803072,Michelle,The location is great for being in that area of Salem.  The hosts are very kind.
30442754,498472907,2019-07-29,24476277,Ashley,A cute little house that was perfect for our weekend getaway.
30442754,502643177,2019-08-04,154105331,Jennifer,"We have two small dogs, this fenced in little bungalow was absolutely perfect for our baby girls! The hosts really thought of everything in the house but we are pretty easy to please. The house was designed beautifully, warm, inviting, and comfortable. They have a mini fridge/freezer and portable ac which was sooooo needed and perfect! (I saw a heater and lots of extra blankets too so it will be fabulous in the winter as well) Check in was so easy! No coordinating with someone to try to make it there at an exact appointment time. Stress free and everything was ready and waiting when we got there! Great place to land for the weekend. Great location to all things you need. Wine country wasn’t too far of a trek and if you want to come home to the yard to drink a bottle with nice chairs and a fire pit table, that was great too! I loved the ambiance of the twinkle lights when we arrived, it was a breath of fresh air from a long work week. All in all we will be back, it was perfect!"
30442754,508338655,2019-08-12,62015698,Shanthi,"Great host for dog lovers, with a lovely yard with grass and a good setup for dogs (doggy bed, food/water bowls). Not a great setup for cooking, but there is a hot plate and microwave. Very quick to get from the AirBNB to downtown restaurants and attractions, and you can walk to get groceries."
30442754,515341917,2019-08-22,83156920,Sarah,"Very clean and nicely appointed. Tight space for 3 large bodies but great for solo, couple or plus small child."
30442754,517685997,2019-08-25,235991623,Mercer,"Cute little hidden bungalow in Salem. It was fairly small but it was perfect for 2 people and 2 pups. Very relaxing. I appreciate how dog friendly they are. Dog bed and dog bowls were provided. Nice yard as well, however the fence is a bit tall and both of the dogs were able to escape. Friendly hosts!"
30442754,522192052,2019-09-01,113917127,Kiana,"This location is perfect! So close to downtown and pretty much everything you need. The bungalow was perfect for two people and a furry friend. They provided dog bowls and a dog bed if you need it! The backyard is so adorable and is perfect if you want to keep your dog back there and watch them run around. We had one single complaint and it is that when we went to lay down for the night we noticed a good amount of dog hair. We read the house rules and it said no dogs on the furniture so we complied but someone else did not. I also don’t know if that means the sheets hadn’t been cleaned prior to us coming which gave me a weird feeling when laying in the bed. Other than that, this place was very nice "
30442754,529317475,2019-09-14,135112412,Muriel,Experience was similar to photos
30442754,531130833,2019-09-16,10832439,Sarah,"This is a sweet little place! Super clean with extra touches like chocolates, popcorn and really good teas. 

It has the perfect fenced yard for dogs. Plus a comfy dog bed and bowls. It was really nice to have our dogs welcomed, 

I would recommend this to anyone traveling through Salem."
30442754,533475128,2019-09-21,53228956,Collin,Cozy little space.  Very stylish and well decorated!  It even came with a complimentary bottle of wine!  The location is not far from downtown Salem and provides easy access to a host of fine establishments.
30442754,535995361,2019-09-25,18472574,Miranda R,"What an adorable bungalow!  Aimee and Bill had it all decorated and set up quite comfortably, including some fall decor for the season- it made it feel extra homy.
All things were thought of to make your stay easy- coffee, wine, snacks- and towels and blankets, my friend was excited over the Q-Tips .
Even a dog bed and doggy bowls for my little one.  
There were chairs and a BBQ outside and a small fire pit- with your own little fenced in yard area.
Bedding was nice and clean.
It was a great location and easy to find.
Great hosts- and they came to greet us and be sure we had what we needed- and even gave us tips for dinner and a winery.
Thank you for being great hosts!
I was here on business but had a friend with me who was babysitting my dog while I was at my event and the two of us had a lot of stuff - but still the bungalow fit us and was cozy!"
30442754,539160182,2019-09-30,295581513,Patricia,Wonderful place to stay it is small but had everything we needed
30442754,547224159,2019-10-14,38109943,Radha,"Such a cozy and sweet space! Perfectly close to the natural foods store and downtown! Perfect for Willamette parents to visit :)  The bed was super comfy and Aimee even provided an additional heater for those chilly nights. We loved the outdoor fire pit for evening relaxing.  We used the crock pot to make a soup from thugs we bought at the Saturday Farmers Market downtown! It was so delicious. 
Thanks for everything!!!!!"
30442754,559346316,2019-11-03,165497869,Keely,"This was a cute little space, in a nice location in town. Great communication by hosts, with quick responses."
30442754,562447233,2019-11-10,303996694,Khristy,Wonderful cozy cottage. Very clean and very quick response to any questions. Great lil touches for our pup we will stay again!!
30442754,571093994,2019-11-30,311188939,Carly,This was a wonderful place to stay while we were away from home.
30442754,580562917,2019-12-22,23582803,Charles,"The cottage was a fantastic place for us to stay during our holiday visit. Aimee and Bill’s place is super pet friendly, clean and comfortable. Will definitely stay here again if we are in town."
30442754,582837185,2019-12-27,155235331,Josie,Cozy and tucked away this spot is nice and close to the main drag but doesn’t feel like it. Also a lovely center point between the mountains and the beach if your up for a drive! We really enjoyed our stay.
30442754,607490063,2020-02-17,335772158,Andrew,"Was a overall good trip! No major complaints! Small things here and there like some of the dishes being slightly dirty, but besides that was a great place to stay!"
30442754,626191726,2020-05-25,70978844,Susan,"A cozy, comfortable spot to stay! Absolutely everything in order, and great communication. We especially appreciated the generous, fenced space for our medium sized dog."
30442754,627378803,2020-06-01,255231529,Jane,"This is a lovely little place. It was so nice to have a big yard to hang out in. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. The Roku TV was a nice touch. The location is perfect (close to town but still very quiet). The hosts were very responsive and responded immediately to our queries. The kitchen is not really a full kitchen with just a hot plate and only one pot so if you want to cook full meals, it is a bit of a challenge. It is a bit small for the price but nice place especially if you have a dog. The yard is great as long as it’s good weather."
30442754,628376342,2020-06-07,8190466,Amanda,"This place is a great find! Bill and Aimee have thought of everything and more. This bungalow has incredible amenities and is very well located in town. We loved having our own space that we could bring our pup to, and the private backyard space was a fantastic surprise. We will definitely keep this place in mind for next time."
30442754,631726447,2020-06-23,138949331,Jd,"Safe, quiet and secure. A great space for dogs, my dogs loved the yard. The owners are very friendly and communicate well.  Simple access to the house. The space is very clean...immaculate! Keep in mind that the house is only about 300sqf. It’s enough space for 2 adults and small dogs..maybe small kids...3 adults would be very crowded."
30442754,633878214,2020-07-01,67116292,Judy,Quiet area and has sufficient space to be comfortable.  Easy access in and out with privacy in the back yard.  Worked really well for traveling with our dog.
30442754,635997641,2020-07-08,50751069,Erik,Cozy little spot near central Salem. 45 minutes out to trail of ten falls. Super cute place that has everything you need. Highly recommend
30442754,637540929,2020-07-12,56428665,Emily,"Great cottage, fast communication, perfect location and pet friendly with private yard!"
30442754,643455573,2020-07-27,35193957,Linda,"Bill and Aimee’s place is comfortable for 2 people, it would be a bit cramped with more. It’s on a quiet street which is nice with a parking space for guests. Bill and Aimee were quick to respond but we did not meet them."
30442754,644832433,2020-07-31,379459,Andy,It’s all about the yard. Thanks for the great retreat!
30442754,647036215,2020-08-05,33862452,Annie,A charming and chic back house--a private big yard in front helped to open up the space! Great hosts as well!
30442754,654930386,2020-08-22,223353428,Tierra,"Would totally stay here again! Cute private space, comfy bed, & it was the only place on our vacation that had its own fenced yard for our dog. It was so nice! Very close to everything in Salem. Aimee was very nice & gave us so many good recommendations for things to do, places to eat, etc."
30442754,657974840,2020-08-29,126830592,Liz,"We were in town visiting elderly parents, and due to covid precautions wanted a separate place to stay. The cottage is cute and tidy. Well laid out, perfect for 2. The windows all have screens and provide good cross breeze (there is also a fan and a mini a/c unit, we didn't need either). Plenty of privacy to have the door open to the fully fenced yard. Kitchen is efficient and has the basics, bed was extremely comfortable. Self check-in/out was easy. Would recommend."
30442754,661911627,2020-09-07,330074638,Katie,"Cute little place to stay, close to everything, comfortable bed!"
30856834,364963157,2018-12-31,79997699,Stacy,"Sanctuary on High was exactly that for our family -- a sanctuary - and an impeccably clean and very well appointed sanctuary in the perfect location at that.  The photos don't do the classic charm and comfort justice.  It was so well appointed that we were able to host an impromptu dinner party for our extended family during a time of duress.  Just when we thought we might have to deduct a star for no ice cream scoop -- we found two.  Did I mention the outdoor fireplace and poker chips we put to good use? And Susan -- Susan could not have been more helpful and accommodating. Check in, check out, and all things in between were a breeze. This place would be great for families, business travelers, couples, groups...  (there are two king size beds and two twins - with lovely, cozy linens).  Particularly for our family during this tender time, this house definitely lived up to its name.  Five well earned stars - for sure."
30856834,369228233,2019-01-09,139124220,Bryanna,"Whether you are looking for a romantic getaway for 2 or a multi-generational trip this house will meet all of your needs. Sanctuary on High is a charming historic home that has been beautifully updated from top to bottom. It has been decorated with a warm and inviting farmhouse theme that will make you feel completely at home from the moment you walk in the front door. 
The kitchen has beautiful Stainless steel appliances and everything you could possibly need to make meals both big and small. I prepared breakfast and dinner every day during our 5 day stay and everything I needed (other than food) was provided. The pass thru area located in front of the sink seats 4 comfortably and keeps you feeling connected to the activity in the family room while you are preparing meals. 
The family room has comfortable leather furniture, cozy blankets and a wonderful gas fireplace for cool evenings. There is a nice selection of books for varying interests and ages. The TV is large and equipped with Roku and access to Netflix if you have an account. The closet near the backdoor has several different games and jigsaw puzzles for added entertainment. My kids ages 10 and 11 had so much fun playing Headbands and we put 3 of the puzzles together during our stay. 
All 3 bedrooms are located upstairs along with a master bath and full bath. My kids loved the bedroom with the 2 twin beds. It is very cozy and decorated perfectly for any child. The closet and dresser had plenty of room for their clothes. The room didn't have a TV, but there is space to sit on the floor or bed and play games, read or just chat.
The master is spacious with a sitting area, large closet, comfy bed and TV. There is also a fan for ""white noise""  if you are a light sleeper...the street out front does get busy around 8 am and 5 pm. 
There is a large park located less than a block away that has a playground and walking trails. We loved taking our kids there and watching them run and play and laugh. It was a very enjoyable and relaxing area so close to downtown! 
The host Susan was the icing on the cake.  I am a VERY light sleeper. I mentioned this in a message prior to our trip date and asked if there were any fans or white noise machines in the home. She responded that there were not but that she would get one there before our arrival. Not only did she follow thru but there were TWO brand new fans ready for use when we got there. There were so many small touches and attention to details like this that made our stay everything we could have hoped and more. She was quick to respond and very helpful with local tips.
If I could give this home and Susan more than 5 stars I would!! I  recommend this house without hesitation. It will be the first choice for our family next time we are in the Salem area."
30856834,401161215,2019-01-13,210372449,Catharine,"The house was wonderfully decorated, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything one would need. Lots of rooms to spread out and relax too. A nice quick walk to downtown restaurants."
30856834,405865211,2019-01-27,100334645,Abigail,"Oh my goodness, this place was everything in the description plus so much more! The house is in the perfect location; basically across the street from Bush Park, the library and a few blocks from downtown. It’s walkable to so many great places!! The house is beautiful! It was recently renovated and it seemed the owners took everything into consideration! It was styled well but also very comfortable and livable! Perfection!! The amenities were amazing as well! The kitchen was fully stocked with any kitchen tool, appliance and most spices! I can’t say enough good things! There were even games and the backyard is the perfect size for playing! We had the best time and our host was so accommodating!! We’ve found our perfect vacation spot in Salem!!"
30856834,414171765,2019-02-18,239643178,Patricia,"Wonderful, cozy with all you need. This is a gem of a place!  Great style with attention to detail made this a home away from home. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Salem."
30856834,419315529,2019-03-03,15982342,Bev,"What a great, comfortable space to stay -- you won't want to leave!  The entire place is in pristine condition -- we seemed to be their first guests ever though I know we weren't -- but it was that clean and neat.  The decor is fun -- lots of nice little touches!  It has a beautiful kitchen -- we barely used it, but it's well stocked and convenient for those who might want to.  The bed and bath linens are beautiful and of top quality!  Our Hostess was super responsive and caring that our stay was trouble-free.  We had a brisk walk (it was a dry, but very cold weekend) to a fun breakfast place and another walk to a beautiful near-by Park.  I can't recommend this place too highly!"
30856834,423023283,2019-03-12,244813136,Aaron,We had such a great time in this amazing house. It was very clean and had everything needed to keep my kids busy ( Games/Internet/Roku). The home was nicely decorated which gave it an amazing feel that made it seem like we were right at home.

30856834,442140748,2019-04-22,32357964,Jim,"Wonderful location, beautiful and very comfortable home. We always looked forward to coming home at end of day. Backyard is an oasis of calm and beauty.

30856834,456534994,2019-05-21,234856774,George,"A very well maintained property, with all the amenities and feeling of your own home!
Located just minutes from Downtown and many restaurants, yet far enough to be peaceful and quiet. Congrats to the owners for an amazing renovation, care and decor to an older property with incredible charm. Would stay again without a doubt!"
30856834,459776642,2019-05-27,256348759,Jennifer,This was an awesome experience staying at this property. The pictures don’t do it justice. Everything a guest could need is available. It is an historic home but with modern touches. Honestly the home of my dreams. If you have the chance to stay here you should!

Jump in your car and just minutes to a freeway entrance. Easy check-in. Loved the space out back for bbq two different nights. Master bed was great!! Kitchen had everything we needed and more. Who knows... Might make another trip of it. The girls loved it."

Susan was very helpful and responsive."
30856834,526326504,2019-09-08,90160540,Jeff,"We only stayed for a couple of nights but enjoyed every minute we were in the house. Susan was quick to respond to any and all questions, check in was a breeze, location was great and close to downtown and Bush Park, which made it easy to get to every place we needed to go. The house was also spotless, with comfortable beds, clean bathrooms and lots of extra touches. If ever you wanted to stay in a vacation rental that feels like a ""home away from home"", this is it!"
30856834,538507741,2019-09-29,285476213,Tara,Home away from home!  Very cozy and inviting. Perfect location for the visiting Willamette parents to stay.  Will reserve again!

Would definitely recommend and stay again!"
30856834,559840268,2019-11-04,210372449,Catharine,"A fun charming place to stay  when visiting Salem. A great location close to downtown, restaurants and wineries. This was our second visit and it was just as perfect as the first."
30856834,570547750,2019-11-29,303150695,David,Awesome place and perfect for our family! Would absolutely stay again and recommend it to anyone - 10 Stars!!! Traditional but yet Modern and so well equipped and stocked! Great location in peaceful neighborhood. Simply the Best.
30856834,582277685,2019-12-26,28353059,Verna,A Well appointed home with everything you could need. Great neighborhood.
30856834,586400551,2020-01-01,60430601,Eileen,This is one of the nicest AirBnB's I've stayed at. In addition the host made us feel very welcome. The location was within walking distance to the Elsinore theater and many great restaurants. The kitchen was well stocked and we enjoyed cooking together as a family most evenings. I would love to come back here again.
30856834,594501101,2020-01-18,54146969,Amy,"Such a beautiful and charming place. We really loved all of the hidden surprises. Like a crock pot which we used to make soup! Yum, Yum!! There were so many extras! Pots, pans, and bowls in all sizes. Plenty of dishes, glasses and silverware. Pretty much every cooking utensil you could ever need. Lots of great starter ingredients for meals. Paper products, toiletries. Access to so many streaming services was super nice. The fireplace!!! We even found the closet full of board games. We were so overwhelmed by the many details that were added to make our stay so nice. The house is so convenient to the historic Salem area. Plenty of restaurants and shopping. There’s a really nice park in walking distance. It’s only a 5 minute drive from Willamette. It’s only about 10 minutes from I-5, so you can easily get to many other tourist sites in the area. I would totally recommend this place for vacations and extended business stays. Just not the weeks I need it.  (;"
30856834,610847458,2020-02-25,25369875,Lily,"We had good memories because of our new born baby in Susan's house. However, there are safety problems and clean issues made us frightened and feeling treated unfair!
1. Safety problem
There is a big platform outside of the second floor. One night, when I was feeding my baby, there was torch light and noise outside. In the morning, we found lots of fresh footprints around the small door and the bathroom window. More horrible, the wood screen window was forced open! Luckly, we locked the glass window.
2. Clean issues
We were mediated by Susan with the reason of ""extremely dirty""""body odor"" house we checked out. How could we raise a new born baby in that environment?!
Please use your camera with dates and take photos of everything when you check-in. Including every blanket, kitchen towel, dirty spot, fake plants…otherwise, you may need to pay more than $1000 extra fees as missing, damage and extra cleaning fee. Fortunately, we did not rent from Susan directly. Airbnb refused this extra fee.

We felt the host didn't see what we did for protecting and keeping the house as clean as possible. Some behaviors and words made us feel unfair. We solved the problems dosent means they did not exist. 

Hope to improve better."
30856834,619521018,2020-03-17,132512865,Rebecca,What an amazing house! The pictures do not do it justice. The house is so charming and beautifully appointed. Susan is an awesome host. I would love to stay at this home again and I plan on it if I am ever in Salem again.
30856834,630642700,2020-06-19,313476667,Kevin,Great stay. I will definitely book it again when I return to Salem. 5 stars
30856834,700042337,2020-10-12,86379879,Lisa,"This is by far the nicest place we’ve ever stayed in. We were visiting for our daughter’s wedding and it was perfect. Susan has thought of everything you might need, short of your own clothes, and then some. 
The house couldn’t be nicer and is in a fabulous location- near a beautiful park, Willamette U and downtown. For us it was even better than staying at the really lovely Grand Hotel (which we have enjoyed in the past). We highly recommend it!"
31005128,367403487,2019-01-04,122878007,Susan,"Great hostess!!  Answers questions right away, if you run out of anything...Susan is right here with replacements,  if you need directions to places to go ...susan can help you out!! ❤️☮️"
31005128,408232676,2019-02-03,163499470,April,"Susan’s place was perfect! Clean, bright, relaxing and the perfect place to power down for a few days in between a busy work trip. Very thoughtful touches and adorable set up of space. It was the perfect get away."
31005128,414143955,2019-02-18,112002831,Natalie,"Lovely space, gracious hosts."
31005128,434430916,2019-04-07,69100998,Linda,"Susan's guest cottage is in a great location in Salem.  It is not too far from the 5 or downtown Salem.  The bed is AMAZING.  It was tough leaving and getting up every morning, but it was wonderful for the month my boyfriend and I were there.  Susan is extremely quick to respond to any queries and regularly checked up to see if we needed anything.  If we are ever in need of an Airbnb in the Salem area again, we will definitely be checking to see if Susan's space is available!"
31005128,441352384,2019-04-21,256915328,Jay,"The view was lovely, there were plenty of cooking things and snacks, places to get food were less than a mile away, and there was clear communication regarding the location and rules that made my stay easy and relaxing."
31005128,448939267,2019-05-05,21566443,Mary Jane,Lovely little cottage. Host was very hospitable. I would definitely stay here again.
31005128,460213837,2019-05-28,247309417,Randy,"Great experience, very cozy place surrounded by large trees and next to the creek. Susan was very responsive if I needed to contact her. I would stay here again!!"
31005128,474091247,2019-06-22,6572039,Kelly,"Susan's place was perfect for our family of three. The place was centrally located,  and the host was very pleasant and easy to communicate with. She was readily available to offer local tips or to attend to any needs we had. We would stay here again for sure."
31005128,479240304,2019-06-30,4048426,Kelly,My boyfriend and I had a great stay here. I would definitely stay here again.
31005128,483713331,2019-07-07,58794629,Sue,Darling cottage on idyllic creek. Everything you could want to make your stay easy and convenient. And sparkling clean to boot!  Thanks Susan
31005128,488252964,2019-07-14,88770365,Daniel,"I'd like to start by saying how kind and knowledgeable Susan is. My partner and I just moved to the area and she answered every question and concern we could think of. She also graciously allowed my service animal despite her severe allergies and opened the gate for us the next day when we forgot one of her toys. 
Susan's guesthouse was stocked with *everything* you need for a weekend getaway. Full bathroom with all the essentials, washer/dryer, two Roku TVs (one in the living room, one in master) for entertainment- even board games, magazines, and a deck of cards! Along with a stovetop, oven, fridge, microwave, and everything else you'd want in a kitchen, Susan stocked the kitchen with spices, basic oils and such, and every kitchen utensil you'd need. We especially enjoyed the fireplace, river views, and slept like BABIES on her king Purple Mattress. Above all, the guesthouse was extremely clean, comfortable, and enjoyable- we would definitely stay again."
31005128,489935461,2019-07-17,3475259,Denise,"Lovely , tranquil little place right on Mill Creek .
I was in Salem for the birth of grandchild # 4 at nearly Salem Hospital and was spending the nights at the hospital.
Susan’s place was the perfect , quiet retreat to sleep and rest through the day , and to sit by the creek with a cup of tea ! Will definitely reb"
31005128,492898404,2019-07-21,144689715,Susan,A hidden gem near Salem 
31005128,499039632,2019-07-30,217956121,Caitlin,Susan’s place was great! The bed was wonderful and she was very accommodating for our last minute stay! Can’t go wrong with her place!
31005128,502649242,2019-08-04,252907561,John,Very nice spot to stay!
31005128,510222017,2019-08-15,128896619,Earl,"Many amenities!  Having a secure, locking gate was a great feature. Friendly, helpful host!"

31005128,519055891,2019-08-27,227391904,Anibal,Excellent place for a little get away. Private and cozy! Would definitely stay there again. Friendly and clean. Had everything we needed and more. Great hosts.
31005128,521255771,2019-08-31,25242686,Tori,My husband and I stayed at Susan's place while we attended the state fair. She had the sweetest touches and extra amenitites for our stay. The house is in a great quiet location. We will definitely stay there again.
31005128,522253712,2019-09-01,20040846,Arian,"Very tidy and accommodating space. Lots of privacy, comfort and a great view from the living room window."
31005128,527810938,2019-09-11,28729987,Daniel,"This is a nicely maintained cottage, with attention given to little extras.  It is easy to park, and private.  This is not a walking community area, so do expect short drives for shopping, and restaurants—that’s perfectly OK.  Kitchen area could still use a little development to be complete.  We did enjoy our stay!"
31005128,602786348,2020-02-07,80786409,Edna,This guesthouse is located along a quiet river.  It is extremely clean and convenient.  We will likely look for availability here again when we visit Salem and will recommend it to relatives that will also likely be coming to town.  The cook surface is an electric griddle and burner.
31005128,632355705,2020-06-26,349913491,Timothy,"If you are looking for a home a way from home this is the place you want. There’s a creek running behind the house with ducks, geese and squirrels a great place to relax. I would definitely stay here again."
31005128,634611349,2020-07-04,137206289,Mj,"The place was overall very nice to stay in. Clean and cozy. No dirty smells from anywhere. 
We came into town late and only stayed one night. I must admit that when we drove up, the area didn’t seem to be very nice. I wasn’t sure where we were , but sketch seemed like about the correct gut feeling.  However, I don’t know Salem very well so I can’t be a great judge on that.  Once we got into her driveway, everything looked great and was a very pleasant stay."
31005128,641466757,2020-07-23,231769471,Mohammed,"It was so perfect and nice place to live in. I enjoyed so much 
The only problem is the remote control of the air conditioning it’s not in the house so i have to decide about live in so cold place or so hot 
I wish if the remote control was there to i can close it when I don’t want it or turn it on when i need it 

But everything else was s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) perfect 

Thank you Susan"
31005128,643432329,2020-07-27,192478951,Stephen,By a nice river you can sit by and relax just outside your door.
31005128,645340162,2020-08-01,174563611,Victoria,This is a very charming place to stay with all you will need to cook a lovely dinner and sit out back in the peaceful yard watching the Beautiful creek. Susan has this place sparkling clean and well stocked for whatever you may need. I particularly enjoyed the handmade goats milk soap. The bed is very comfortable for a great nights sleep as you explore the area. Check in was simple and self serve.  I would definitely book again!!
31005128,646757717,2020-08-04,154084107,Brad,"Their place was tidy and clean. Had some nice amenities. The communication was great! 
Wouldn’t mind seeing a little more functional cooking surface but it’s a nice place to stay."
31005128,655738120,2020-08-23,62215379,Kyle,"We enjoyed a peaceful stay and like sitting out in the chairs by the creek. We found it to be a clean, safe, quiet spot and enjoyed walking around the neighborhood in the morning. The hosts are helpful, clear, and professional. The guitar and charging station were nice touches."
31005128,661319691,2020-09-06,16214521,James,"Susan's place is clean, comfortable, and conveniently located for visitors to Salem. It was easy to check in and get settled and Susan even left a few items like phone charges that one seems to forget or never have enough of.  Despite being so close to the town it feels very private and quiet. We really enjoyed our stay!"
31005128,669407075,2020-09-29,7227372,Jeri,"My parents stayed at Susan's place in Salem because they had been displaced due to the wildfires. Susan made everything easy for us to get checked-in, what to know about the listing, and gifted a certificate for a local restaurant so my parents could go out to a meal. The listing was clean, quiet, private and had all the amenities to make this a perfect home away from home. It's also well situated in Salem if you have a car to get around. Very grateful to Susan for my parent's great stay!"
31005128,670549227,2020-10-03,299903036,Daniel,Awesome place and amazing host! Quiet and secure. Everything you'll need is provided! Thanks so much!
31907842,421532190,2019-03-09,20158652,Theo,A beautiful place in a great part of Salem. Great hosts.
31907842,424002732,2019-03-15,121142303,Catherine,Great place! Nice hosts! Thank you so much for a great stay!
31907842,426691362,2019-03-21,28369674,Ramond,"The space is large and very comfortable. Plenty of privacy, and very easy access to the capital and downtown. 100% recommend to anyone staying in Salem. Great family. Great home."
31907842,427010030,2019-03-22,14296016,Melanie,"This is an outstanding find! Christopher and Jackie's place was exactly what I needed after a really long day! My check in time changed throughout the day and they were very accommodating and responsive. Jackie met me in the driveway to get me settled into the space - even though it was well past 9pm. The unit is on the third floor of the house (so heed the warning about stairs) with a completely separate entrance.  
The space is very clean and nicely appointed. Lots of pillows - which I love. They had very thoughtful touches; SOFT towels, a bag of good ground coffee, fans for both bedrooms, and a noise machine next to the queen bed to drown out any traffic noise. The bath was nice and deep - great for a relaxing tub. There is no TV (which was great for me) in the unit - instead they supplied a small bookshelf with a variety of books for any interest. 
I frequently have to stay in Salem for work and Jackie and Christopher's space will be the first place I try to book from now on."
31907842,428705835,2019-03-25,144517332,Akshay,Jackie and Christopher were amazing hosts! It was my first time to Oregon and this was the perfect host and house. They were very nice and the location was amazing! Conveniently placed and a few minutes from downtown. Definitely would love to stay here again.
31907842,429049116,2019-03-26,54682513,Haley,"Can I please just move in? This AirBnb is so lovely, comfortable and a great location. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I arrived much later than expected and Jackie stayed up to greet me and show me the space. It’s beautiful and I only wish I could’ve stayed longer. They had a white noise machine next to the bed too which I’ve always wanted to try. Thank you!"
31907842,429362835,2019-03-27,145736351,Taylor,"This place is in a perfect location for exploring Salem. (It would also be great if you have to do any work in downtown Salem.) It is a very charming victorian home that has been tastefully updated. The kitchen is a huge plus, especially if you are trying to save money on dining! We would love to stay here again."
31907842,430469694,2019-03-30,5423866,Gina,"This is a beautiful space with its own private entrance, and especially wonderful for families - I came with my 5 year old son and he loved having his own little room. It was also very nice for me to have a living room to relax in after he went to bed. Lovely decorating with thoughtful touches, sparkling clean, nice soft beds and linens, lots of useful kitchen tools, deep tub for soaking. It's a little drafty when it's chilly as it's an older home but the heater is very fast and powerful and you have control over it. It's such a charming apartment and I was really pleased with it. Also a great location convenient to downtown and kind and welcoming hosts. I had an emergency where my wallet was missing and Jackie called the last place I used it without my even asking. Lovely place to stay. I highly recommend it!"
31907842,431370391,2019-03-31,184811387,Kurt,"This spot is great! In a very easy to get to part of Salem. The stay was quiet and the apartment was cute. Great value, great stay."
31907842,432066327,2019-04-02,59064786,Phil,"Great place and outstanding hosts! 
I highly recommend."
31907842,432685189,2019-04-04,8025882,Iris Maria,"This is a great place to stay when looking for a few nights in Salem. Walking distance to downtown and the state agency/Capitol buildings. The space is incredibly comfortable and relaxing -- has all the ""things' you may need (and a great book selection that you didn't know you needed!)"
31907842,433118341,2019-04-05,21343050,Nora,"Very cozy and cute space. My stay was very short, but if I ever need to stay in Salem again, this is the spot!"
31907842,433508544,2019-04-06,47928165,Kevin,"This was the perfect location near downtown Salem for what I was looking for. It was sparkling clean, comfortable, private and just as described. Jackie and Chris made themselves available as needed. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the kitchen has everything needed to prepare a lite meal. The only hiccup to my stay was the breaker switched off while the microwave was running. Definitely a great stay."
31907842,438825102,2019-04-17,25620333,Phil,"This is a beautiful and charming upstairs flat in a great location. Jackie and Christopher are doing some landscaping projects outside at the moment that complicate the access a bit, but the space and location are well worth it."
31907842,439796493,2019-04-19,251149781,Calista,"This air bnb was great! The space was super cozy and all around very nice to stay in! The only downsides would be the super steep stairs leading to the space and the creaky floors as it’s hard not to be too loud. I’m aware these are unfixable so it’s really no issue, just a heads up."
31907842,441244547,2019-04-21,92727880,Brenda,Very friendly hosts!!! A very clean and unique space.We loved the old house charm!!!
31907842,442562202,2019-04-23,251631184,Nora,Great place to stay if you are in the Salem area! The space is great and spacious. The house is beautiful. Jackie and Christopher are so gracious. Highly recommend!
31907842,442940508,2019-04-24,30856247,Natalie,"Perfect walking distance to the capital buildings and located in a really adorable neighborhood! The space is stylishly decorated but still comfy and welcoming. Jackie is an excellent hostess and very responsive: if I need to come to Salem again, this is where I will be staying!"
31907842,445648134,2019-04-29,137191775,Sibre,"Comfortable stay in a fantastic location. Lots of helpful little touches - like salt and pepper in the kitchen, travel-size toothpaste in the bathroom, and a residential parking guest pass - really made it a great experience."
31907842,446104305,2019-04-30,258304579,Earth-Feather,"We absolutely recommend this place. We will stay again, if given the opportunity."
31907842,447446551,2019-05-03,179263517,Daniel And Debra,"Jackie and Christopher are the quintessence of warm, thoughtful hospitality.  We couldn't ask for better.  Besides their helpfulness and kindness, we experienced excellent accommodations--very clean, comfortable, fully equipped kitchen with excellent stove/oven and fridge, two nicely dedicated sleeping areas with very comfy beds, outstanding bathroom with a shower I want to beam over to our house!  The tone and tenor of the family was beautiful--truly a connected, loving family.  The northside location spurred me and my son to walk lots, including to the nearby downtown area, Riverfront, Willamette University campus, and State Capitol Building.  The truth is experiencing this family and their hospitality was in itself worth the very modest price of admission!"
31907842,448066754,2019-05-04,231463023,Sara,They were wonderful hosts! The location was perfect for where we needed to go the following day
31907842,448888986,2019-05-05,11111927,Jennifer,"Don't even hesitate to stay here. AMAAAZING accommodations with great views of the tree tops. Sun streams in come morning, comfy beds, and the shower is the bomb Jackie was a sweetheart and met our every need. I can;t wait to come back to this little oasis in Salem:)"
31907842,450210764,2019-05-08,251369692,Hannah,"I used this space for a boudoir shoot, and it was absolutely beautiful. It was very clean and well decorated and would be a very comfortable place to stay."
31907842,450560253,2019-05-09,253489546,Sharon,"Very cute 3rd floor studio with kitchen, plenty of hot water and comfortable beds."
31907842,452747279,2019-05-13,216288540,Joni,"This was a home away from home experience! The suite is comfortable, extremely clean and full of charm. Christopher and Jackie are very friendly and accommodating, and communication is very quick. Having the kitchen was a huge plus for us, and we took full advantage of it. Small extras were appreciated  (room fans some toiletries, extra towels,  a few snacks and COFFEE! ) 

As the host have mentioned in their listing, there are quite a few stairs up to the suite, so if you have mobility issues concerns keep that in mind. 

We hope to come back and stay here again definitely recommend it!"
31907842,453033279,2019-05-14,74691251,Joseph,"Nice home, great people"

31907842,454605852,2019-05-18,22903802,Christian,Great place.
31907842,457735748,2019-05-24,89609098,Chandra,"Great location if you want to be downtown. Stairs can be tricky (I should have packed lighter!). Nicely equipped kitchen, bathroom was beautifully decorated and charming. Main bed is a double so might be too cozy for a couple but comfy for one person, could definitely have another person in the twin and a third on the fold-out couch if needed. Wonderfully thoughtful touches, lots of pillows, blankets, fans, towels and more."
31907842,459035960,2019-05-26,88672419,Megan,"The space was as described, very clean, and also cute. We didn’t hear any noise from the house below. It’s a lovely place and close to downtown, easy street parking. We would stay again!"

31907842,464444636,2019-06-05,225802916,Haley,This place was adorable and spotless. Great hospitality and they had everything I could’ve needed.
31907842,472013133,2019-06-18,15978243,Stormy And Conor,"These hosts really embody the spirit of AirBnb: attentive, locally based and engaged with the space and guest which is exactly where I want my lodging dollars to go. The space is immaculately clean and furnished in a really cozy and homespun way."
31907842,472980175,2019-06-20,79124492,Kathleen,Super cute studio. Very clean and comfortable. Everything you need is there. The WiFi isn’t the best but it does its job. The street is also a bit noisy but you are on the third floor so you have a bit of distance from the traffic sounds. Other than that Jackie was very accommodating and generous! I would highly recommend this place!
31907842,476220259,2019-06-25,50828280,Robert,Great place.

One thing to be aware of are the amount of stairs. There are stairs on the deck and then a small, but steep & narrow flight to access the rooms. Those with any mobility issues should be wary."
31907842,479396898,2019-06-30,16543269,Kurtis,"This is a beautiful home and a really fun space to stay in. Jackie was responsive and helpful the whole stay and the house was wonderful. Craftsman style home, your own private entrance to the top floor and a real gem. I would definitely stay here again if I found myself back in Salem."
31907842,510213865,2019-08-15,21726962,Grace,"Such a lovely and comfortable place to live. You get your own kitchen and bathroom so you’re not sharing anything with anyone, which is super important to me. You also get a bunch of supplies of towels and blankets. I love the white noise machine beside one of the beds. The whole family is so welcoming and nice. Jackie is super responsive and accommodating, there’s really nothing negative about this place that I can think of. Would definitely come back!"
31907842,514729044,2019-08-21,72954569,Andrew,Great place at great price! Sparkling clean!

It felt like we were at the top of the world on the third floor, among all the treetops and looking down on the neighborhood roofs. This is a stylish space with lots of room and a full kitchen. We were able to eat in and relax. We appreciated how bright it was with all the windows and all small touches in the decor and kitchen fully stocked with all kinds of amenities. Wonderful and kind hosts! Fantastic hospitality!"

The last staircase is steep but short. The bathtub is one of the best I’ve been in- nice and deep with lots of hot water. There is road noise but really only in the morning. I didn’t use the white noise machine. It was a very enjoyable 3 nights. When I locked myself out, they promptly let me back in. Nice people!!"

31907842,615329643,2020-03-07,138239738,Kayla,If you're in to old house charm this place is for you! Noise from the street can be a bit much at times as the windows are original single pane. Furnishings fit the space and are cute. Bathroom is very spacious and the oversized bath tub is amazing. Parking is at a premium and is on the street.
31907842,617103292,2020-03-11,340214326,Josephine,A great spot.

31907842,621293847,2020-03-29,288659630,Lanelle,This apartment is perfect for a couple it is upstairs above the owners home. I did have teenage boys with me and they could hear them downstairs so I felt bad but location is downtown and convenient check in and parking is very easy.
31907842,622318590,2020-04-12,214271592,Nathan,"Great value. It's centrally located in Salem close to many stores, restaurants, etc. Parking is easy. Nice bathroom and comfortable beds."
31907842,622596285,2020-04-17,163587295,Suki,"The house itself has some old world charm and some stairs (no biggie for this 45 year old nurse). Check-in was as described with pictures. I communicated about staying out first night via AirBNB. Parking on the side street with provided permit works well. The place is fairly private aside from seeing kids out back where the entrance is.  Some white noise from the busier street was suitable for me (had it everywhere I’ve lived over past 20 years).  
In all fairness I didn’t sleep on the beds because I spent the night at a friend’s house. The following day I chose to drive home early after napping on the sofa.  I reported in person about leaving early to ensure lockup and inspection could be done . If circumstances were different between my friend and myself I’d stay again."
31907842,622747340,2020-04-19,191286136,Delainy,Such a cute and clean space and the beds are super comfortable!
31907842,622973581,2020-04-23,1512635,Patricia Jo,"It is a beautiful space with a huge bathtub, but also on an extremely busy street. Even with all the windows closed, I could hear traffic and I didn't get a restful night's sleep."
31907842,623195037,2020-04-26,145895754,Jillian,Cute apartment in great central location. Hosts were very helpful and communicated quickly.
31907842,624464182,2020-05-10,114256221,Karen,Jackie greeted us at check in.  She is a very friendly hostess.  The place was super clean and cute.  It was easy to find and just as described.  We would definitely stay here again next time we're in town!
31907842,625352430,2020-05-19,107931599,Melissa,"Absolutely perfect!! 
You are ""in"" their home, but 100% private and you never feel like your invading someone's space. The apartment is decorated so nice and everything is clean and just really amazing. 
I'm SO grateful we stayed here!!"
31907842,625444282,2020-05-20,145644533,Bethany,"Absolutely enjoyed my stay here. The unit is private, unique, and charming. I had everything that I need, will return back in the future"
31907842,625522015,2020-05-21,158605005,Kayln,"Thank you so much for letting me and my boyfriend stay in your amazing space. I loved all the quirky things about the space we stayed in, from original hardware to the windows! it was amazing thank you again. I will definitely be seeking this space out again in the future as I’ll be in Salem more often! This is definitely a great price for the space you get. The children that live at the house are very respectful as well as helpful! They told us where to go as they were playing outside their house!"
31907842,626701179,2020-05-29,40880859,Mariah,"Great home! Private entrance and comfortable space. Great for long stays. I Warm for the summer months, but there is a window box. Very close the the state capitol! Highly suggest."
31907842,627601297,2020-06-03,58851893,B. Dani,Great little space with a nice view of Salem. Close to downtown.
31907842,627715340,2020-06-04,112043828,Kristina,"I am a local that needed a last minute booking so I could work on my final exams out of my noisy house. 
The place was clean and cozy! Communication was fast and friendly. I also learned about a whole new neighborhood that I hadn’t checked out before. It reminded me of the beautiful neighborhoods in Sellwood PDX and it was centrally located close to downtown.
I will definitely keep this place in the back of my mind when I need a break and I’ll let friends from out of town know that this spot is ideal! 
The stairs are a little weird coming up but I also love the old quirks that come with old houses"
31907842,628323487,2020-06-07,5425843,Daniel,"This was one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at in the PNW. Great central Salem location, scrupulously clean, cute modern design. Large (did I mention clean?) Bathroom. 

Will definitely stay again."
31907842,628687999,2020-06-09,300341947,Catherine,"This space is an adorable little 3rd story walk up, quaint and cute with everything you'll need for a long or short stay. There is a little road noise as mentioned in the description, but with the super comfortable bed, you won't notice at all. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
31907842,629318095,2020-06-13,151192256,Kristin,"We loved staying at Christopher and Jackie’s Airbnb. When we each arrived, each of said out loud that we would rent from them and live in the apartment if we could.
Check in directions were simple and the beds were so comfy."
31907842,630266122,2020-06-17,108925695,Andy,"PROS:

- Great location, super easy check-in, always available street parking, no in-person contact with hosts.
- The view from the top floor is nice. 
- Bathroom is a good size and shower pressure was perfect. 

CONS:

- I wouldn’t say it was dirty, but it wasn’t the cleanest it could have been — and I think this is important especially during a pandemic. The kitchen drawers, cabinets, and silverware were not properly cleaned (crumbs, leftover food stains, etc.) and  there was left over food in the fridge from the people before us. 

- If Jello was a bed, this is it. The beds were far too squishy for my partner and I. Yes, we tried both. We had four tiresome nights of tossing and turning. The mattresses sink in the middle, and both mattresses droop on the sides because the bed frames underneath are a smaller size. 

- I cut my leg on a nail sticking out of the wicker basket in the living room within five minutes of arriving. 

The condition of the space overall left me wondering how thoroughly it’s inspected after every use. Overall, I’d say it’s an okay spot for a quick stay, but I wouldn’t book again."
31907842,630419479,2020-06-18,158605005,Kayln,I love staying here when in Salem for work
31907842,630642618,2020-06-19,90654066,Kendra,"This was such a lovely spot to stay. I definitely would recommend it. It was easy to locate, beautiful views, and the best bathtub ever!"
31907842,630854442,2020-06-20,114256221,Karen,Everything was perfect for our quick over nighter.
31907842,644779094,2020-07-31,221079390,Dave,"Awesome pitstop in our roadtrip up from San Diego to Seattle. We were provided a parking pass free of charge to park our U-haul for the night in front of the listing. One worry was safety of the neighborhood because we had a U-haul, but we had no issues there. Really cool home layout and the 2 A/Cs were great."
31907842,645368059,2020-08-01,71583468,Veronica,Christopher and Jackie had such a lovely home- exactly as advertised. The home is located in a nice quiet neighborhood and amenities are within a few minutes drive. The apartment was super clean and well furnished. There were plenty of clean towels which we definitely appreciated.. We were only in town for the night but it was just what we needed. Thanks again for welcoming us into your home!
31907842,646018257,2020-08-02,173041335,Anel,"Bigger than expected, perfect to sleep three people and great distance from Portland. We really enjoyed our stay at Jackie’s place!"
31907842,648409116,2020-08-08,34858339,Marlene,This place has got to be the perfect example of staying at an attachment into someone's home. There are the flights of stairs but we were for warned. The street is quiet and never did we feel unsafe even when we arrived back late. The space is clean and soooo cute. The beds are a little soft but still very comfortable. We will for sure keep this place in mind when visiting family in town.
31907842,650580474,2020-08-13,12938255,Douglas,"In the heart of downtown, steps yes, but the space is perfectly setup"

Great location, walking distance to parks and downtown activities (well, those that exist during quarantine...). Christopher and Jackie were quickly responsive to all of our questions. I would highly recommend."

31907842,657533080,2020-08-28,21155519,Windy,Super cute space. Great value. Comfortable bed. Close to Willamette University. Larger space than I expected and a very roomy bathroom. Quiet neighborhood. Would stay here again.
31907842,659469378,2020-09-01,316746847,JamesChristian,"We wanted an affordable, yet comfortable place to stay during our short visit to Salem.  Jackie and Christopher's place exactly fit the bill and exceeded our expectations.  The apartment was a little bigger than expected.  The A/C was good at keeping it cool during our 90 degree visit.  Parking was easy to find on Belmont each time.  The place was very clean and well decorated with plentiful storage spaces and a rather large kitchen and bathroom.  The tub is huge and deep.  The water pressure is excellent.  The fridge a good size.  Jackie was always quick to answer our communications before and during our stay as well.  The Wi-Fi was strong enough for what we needed.  We loved the white-noise machine in the main bedroom and the fan was great too.  

If I was asked what could be improved, I would say that having better room-darkening curtains in the bedroom would have made our stay more comfortable.  The morning sun in the summer is powerful and we are used to darker curtains at home and at most hotels we visit.  However, some people might be fine with their darkening ability.  

The whole place is super cute and we will probably stay there the next time we are in Salem."
31907842,660329646,2020-09-04,164841737,Annie,"Wonderful space, great location, friendly family!"

31907842,661299771,2020-09-06,294179351,Joshua,"my favorite three pros:

1. the mattresses were comfortable and the sheets/pillowcases smelled clean. i've been to a lot of airbnb and i swear most airbnb places have the worst mattresses. the larger bed was very nice.
2. the place was very clean. even checked behind the toilet seat and it was clean.
3. responsive hosts to my messages as late as 11 :30 pm and as early as 9 am.
4. has working ac/heater

overall, my partner and i just needed a place to sleep overnight for our road trip up north so the three pros i wrote above were basically the most important aspects i desired. i didn't really have any cons for my trip personally, but i can imagine the below may be potential cons for others. pretty minor stuff.

potential cons:

1. there's no tv. i didn't care for it, but maybe others do.
2. it's like a studio, so no walls between the beds.

5/5 rate from me, thanks."

31907842,665158090,2020-09-17,285550696,Jennifer,"There was terrible wildfire smoke in Salem when I stayed.  Christopher and Jackie had sealed off the windows with towels and had a very nice air conditioning unit running when I arrived.  It was so nice to come in to nice, cool air when I arrived.  I didn’t cook, but the kitchen table was a nice spot for me to enjoy my take out meal.  The suite is on the top floor and is very cute.  There is a lot of charm.  There are original windows, which are beautiful, but do let in a bit of noise from the busy street in front.  The air conditioning was running, so there was white noise, but the traffic sounds didn’t disturb me while I was sleeping.  The bigger bed was just fine and I had no issue with being comfortable.  There were also darkening curtains or rollers in the windows to help block light if needed.  Chris and Jackie were very gracious in answering many questions I had.  Their check in was also very clear and easy."
31907842,665484217,2020-09-18,141425544,William,This is a great place to stay. It has style and charm. We were very comfortable and everything is super easy as a guest here. We would definitely like to stay here again when in Salem.
31907842,666443652,2020-09-20,226740446,Bree,"Christopher and Jackie's suite is in the perfect location for what we needed. Plenty of street parking, and easily accessible. The suite is very cute, well decorated. The queen bed feels like a cloud. We were very comfortable there and highly recommend."
31907842,667335208,2020-09-23,25135966,Joanna,The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. The location was an easy distance to downtown.
31907842,668187287,2020-09-26,149462767,Alyssa,"A comfortable, clean, and cozy space. It was easy to find on-street parking (and there’s a residential pass that goes with the suite). The wi-fi was strong enough for me to be able to work while the kids did online school too! Would highly recommend!"
31907842,669944012,2020-10-01,76594155,Daniel,Beautiful top floor of an old victorian home. Spacious. Overall a great place to stay.

32018098,414059958,2019-02-18,232591155,Dante,"Expect a beautiful house with a beautiful backyard, and nice aesthetics throughout. It was truly one of the better homes to stay in in Salem, Oregon."
32018098,452257166,2019-05-12,220111575,Jerry,It was an absolute pleasure staying in this beautiful home! The owners communicated exactly what we needed to know. I would absolutely stay here again!!!
32018098,461046319,2019-05-30,243304821,Rachelle,"Patricia is an excellent host that goes above and beyond.  We enquired about staying at her home for attending a family wedding at a nearby vineyard.   Not only was the home location perfect, but she provided us with so many wonderful suggestions such as driving along the coast, hiking Silver Falls state park, and local wineries we extended our stay to allow time to explore Oregon.  Her home is warm, clean, beds are comfortable and linens are soft.  She provided all the kitchen amenities needed to enjoy an evening at home relaxing on her patio and hot tub.  After busy days exploring my boys enjoyed watching a movie in their tv work out room while we relaxed in the hot tub.  I highly recommend staying at their home and hope we can visit again.  My husband and I travel often for work and we are accustomed to Hilton, Omni and Starwood properties I would rate their home a 4 star hotel, but with her excellent feedback and costumer service I rate them at 5!"
32018098,466857124,2019-06-09,81111239,Peter And Chanel,"My family and I enjoyed our stay. The backyard is lovely, especially on a nice evening. Everything was comfortable and clean. The hosts’ communication was quick, and informational. The house is pretty segmented so it was hard for my family of 7 to all “hang” out in one room. Overall great accommodations!"
32018098,475180864,2019-06-23,72356528,Traci,Wonderful place to stay enjoyed the house and the gardens with the veggies and herbs
32018098,501561328,2019-08-03,25065087,Jenna,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely home. We had a group of six (three couples), and we had plenty of space. We really enjoyed spending time in the backyard. The hot tub and fire pit were a perfect way to relax in the evenings. Joe was always very prompt with his responses. We would definitely stay at this home again!"
32018098,503912906,2019-08-06,171540485,Mandy,My family and I flew in from all over for a wedding here and we truly enjoyed our stay. Everything is what you would expect from the photos and more! The house is so spacious and clean. We absolutely loved the back yard and fresh veggies from the garden! We appreciated all the amenities and little details. It was warm and welcoming and we enjoyed every part of the house during our stay.
32018098,507682085,2019-08-11,83197075,Taylor,Great place! We loved the back yard area and the beds were very comfy!

32018098,538444078,2019-09-29,32007670,Allison,"The home is beautiful and as advertised. The kitchen was fully equipped and the bonus garden out back added nicely to our dinner. The home is extremely clean and very tastefully appointed. Do are very comfortable and loved the extra touches throughout the home. The backyard is a beautiful area to hang out filled with flowers, vegetables and several sitting areas. Would highly recommend this home."
32018098,546650063,2019-10-13,25244207,Joseph,"So glad we chose this place.  It’s equidistant from Corvallis and Eugene so it was perfect for our trip.  The place is very clean and comfortable.  Patricia and joe are super responsive.  Accessing the house is really easy.  And the hot tub...

The beds are really comfortable and the shower in the master is really nice. 

My only criticism is the price and tv area. It’s a little expensive and there wasn’t a great spot to watch football.  But the other amenities made it worth every penny."
32018098,557732232,2019-11-01,144617507,Chris,"Beautiful home, equipped with all of the amenities you need to enjoy your time in wine country!  Joe and Patricia were great hosts!"

32018098,582311129,2019-12-26,10772124,David,"This place is beautiful. What a great house for a family to rent in Salem. This is the best part of Salem and accommodation in the area is limited. We felt lucky to have such a great place to stay for the holidays. Well equipped kitchen, nice bathrooms, and the media room is really fun. Highly recommend."
32018098,587893991,2020-01-03,284097731,Dave,"Beautiful home, comfortable beds, excellent hosts that responded immediately to us. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks for a wonderful stay, Joe and Patricia!!"
32018098,610079597,2020-02-23,85533215,Vivian,A beautiful home in a nice neighborhood with a pretty view of the water and open fields. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. We enjoyed our stay!

32018098,625252885,2020-05-18,33822372,Tracy,"If you need a place to stay in Salem, look no further than this lovely home!  The house was large and super clean.  The beds were very comfortable and the master bath was one of the best I have ever seen.  Every time we needed something while cooking for our large family, we found exactly what we needed in the large and extremely well stocked kitchen.  Lots of plates, cups, glasses, serving utensils, cookware, etc.  We enjoyed playing cards and games around the large dining table and the backyard was quite lovely, although due to rain we sadly didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would have liked.  But it would be a perfect spot to sit outside and enjoy the sunny weather, lots of seating and tables.  Again, if you need a house to host your family, pick this one, we were VERY happy with it!"
32018098,626259041,2020-05-25,137163813,Raven,This house is so beautiful & cozy! & the host is so sweet! The backyard is nice & big & so is the kitchen. The family & I enjoyed & would definitely recommend!
32018098,629300656,2020-06-13,169459865,Maryanne,"A real oasis and a lovely home for respite in Salem.  Close to wineries, parks, and other activities, too.  In spite of being nestled in the muddle of suburbia, the home has the feel of being tucked away and the decor has the charm of a Tuscan villa.  It’s spacious and we found everything as described.  The owners are very quick to respond to any questions and friendly.  Would absolutely stay here again.  I think it would be perfect for a women’s wine weekend or even a family reunion."
32018098,634082611,2020-07-02,341301039,Bradley,A great house and a great host!  The house is very nice and in a good/safe location.

32018098,640273382,2020-07-19,123755310,Christy,Patricia’s place is beautiful and the back yard is amazing! Pictures don’t do it justice. It was the perfect location and home base for visiting with extended family in the area.  They even had a chilled bottle of wine ready and waiting for us upon arrival. I highly recommend staying here.
32018098,647404910,2020-08-06,57270453,Bessie,This place was one of the best Airbnb we have stayed at. It’s super clean. All the amenities were great. The wine Patricia and Joe graciously offered us was one of the best. We all had a great relaxing time. The house was nicely decorated and very cozy. Very thankful to be enjoying this place during COVID-19. Thanks!!!
32018098,649161694,2020-08-09,275889804,Grant,Beautiful home with nice backyard and hot tub. The location was perfect for us. Host responded immediately to a question. I would highly recommend this rental.
32018098,650605887,2020-08-13,8772706,Elizabeth,"Perfect place for a quiet retreat. Evenings relaxing in the amazing outdoor space and hot tub was total bliss. Location is also fantastic, close to stores, very easy to get to. 
From booking through to the end of our trip, Patricia and Joe were the perfect hosts and we really appreciated all the little touches to make us feel totally welcome! Highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!"

32018098,659443729,2020-09-01,61568502,RaeAnne,"Beautiful, comfortable home.  Perfect for our girl's weekend of hiking, card playing and wine.  The only downside is the stereo is outdated and is only equipped with classical music and jazz.  I suggest bringing your ownwireless speaker."
32018098,663042994,2020-09-11,50555237,Jami,Absolutely stay here.  Home and hosts are wonderful!
32018098,666908901,2020-09-21,54771807,Erika,"We were in town for a family wedding, and this was a great place to stay and all spend time together.  The backyard is beautiful and the perfect space to enjoy each other's company."
32018098,669949941,2020-10-01,8911614,Carisa,This house has everything you need! Fully stocked kitchen! They are very quick to respond to anything you need. The back yard is amazing and has fresh growing veggies to fill your salad with! A hot tub to warm you up! If I had one complaint it would be that the beds are all very firm. I am used to a soft sleep number bed so maybe I am spoiled! Other then that the house was 10 out of 10!
32018098,673648323,2020-10-11,227174175,Lora,Not what I was hoping for.
32018098,701242152,2020-10-17,62349263,Megan,"Our stay at Patricia's place was great!
The bedrooms were all spacious and comfortable and the backyard was beautiful - a great place for families to hang out! 
The host was very accommodating and responsive. I would definitely recommend staying here - especially in Fall (the country roads and miles of vineyards are gorgeous)!"
32133603,411240507,2019-02-11,187388346,Katie,"Amanda's apartment is beautiful, located downtown and a short walk away from almost everything! The creek outside is gorgeous, and we had a great time drinking cocoa and coffee and watching the snow fall during our stay! Amanda was friendly and helpful, all of her communication was really informative and she went out of her way to make sure we were happy with the place and had everything we needed. A gem of a place in Salem!"
32133603,414767175,2019-02-20,177483886,Alan,The pictures don’t do this place justice. Very quaint and quiet as well as a great location. We will be staying here on all our trips to Salem.
32133603,416646058,2019-02-24,53761227,Hailey,Amanda was very quick to respond. The space is right next to a creek which was really nice. The apartment is huge and there was coffee! Always a plus!
32133603,420774080,2019-03-07,38608512,Tammy,"Relaxing, peaceful, creek side setting in the middle of the city! It was surprisingly quiet and it was a nice, home like condo where we had everything we needed to cook our own meals. It was so nice to be able to have our dog with us, as well! The host was flexible and willing to work with us, as our situation changed and we needed to stay a bit longer and add an extra vehicle. Very reasonable price for the stay, also. Highly recommend!"
32133603,426049066,2019-03-19,39870622,Scott,"Very walkable to downtown amenities. Pleasant space. Great coffee drinking spot on patio above creek, weather permitting."

Quick and simple check in also got to park in the back. Home was comfy, clean and perfect. The kitchen was stocked had plenty utensils, pots and whatnot. The best part was the sound of the water I enjoyed that very much ! The balcony was very peaceful. My dog was super happy plenty of space for her to run around. Will deft be coming back in the future ! Thank you Amanda"
32133603,431783939,2019-04-01,7805901,Eric,"This Airbnb was clean, spacious, near the center of town and campus, and quiet.  Lovely location in that it was right overlooking a brook, it felt a bit desolate late at night when we would come home, and there were some street people about, but that was not a problem.  The only criticism we have is that the amenities were fine, but very minimal.  Unlike many air bnbs that we have stayed at it is really a full time rental space so felt a bit like a hotel.  But everything was comfortable, just don't expect books, food in the fridge/cupboards etc."
32133603,432405057,2019-04-03,96485737,Will,Quick responses from a friendly host. She was very friendly and accommodating and responded quickly to food and fun recommendations.
32133603,436273125,2019-04-12,68902419,Margie/Richard,"This place was great! Clean, near downtown and my favorite yoga studio and the offices I need to visit while working in Salem! Amanda responded quickly to any questions and the check in was smooth and easy! It is roomy, a great place on Mill Creek with a beautiful view, quiet, warm and comfortable. The kitchen is stocked with everything I needed if I did not want to go out to eat. I will definitely be back!"
32133603,439300860,2019-04-18,57390596,Luke,"When my corporate employer said the hotels were full in the local area, I saw it as an opportunity. I knew there were options in and around Church St, but I found a little gem with this place. Simple, elegant, and right on the Mill River. Amanda was quick to respond, answered any questions I had promptly and accurately. I was within walking distance to food, entertainment and my meetings, making it very convenient for my three-night stay. I will be staying here again next time I'm in Salem. "
32133603,442057986,2019-04-22,92876106,Oralia,"Pictures don’t so this location justice. The unit is very clean and has many amenities! If we’re ever back, we will definitely book again."
32133603,442903588,2019-04-24,204077076,Patricia,"Great location, near downtown. Loved the creek view from the porch. Will definitely stay here again.."
32133603,443331774,2019-04-25,53892043,Biswajit,A great place to stay right in the middle of the town
32133603,445664764,2019-04-29,247348267,Liane,Quiet neighborhood and the creek is absolutely amazing
32133603,447479034,2019-05-03,57820866,Jeanne,"Clean, convenient, reasonably comfortable. I was surprised by how much difference it made to not have any decoration at all in the place (as noted by another reviewer); it does take away from the experience. And I was really looking forward to staying by the creek, but turns out we had a fine view of the apartment complex on the other side, including someone's exterior floodlights that never shut off. We ended up having to shut all the blinds/curtains - so much for enjoying the creek. That said, it was indeed very clean and convenient to the Capitol, and the host was immediately responsive to my messages to schedule a stay."
32133603,450217823,2019-05-08,186701666,Tiffany & Ben,"Exactly what we needed, friendly & hot back to us quickly!"
32133603,453420314,2019-05-15,68902419,Margie/Richard,"Great place to stay - quiet, comfortable with a beautiful view of the creek. Close to downtown and lots of restaurants - all walking distance!"
32133603,456523882,2019-05-21,41456198,William,"This was a great rental.  The Mill Creek runs along the entire back of the property and if you open the windows, the sound of the running creek transforms the space.  Parking is private and convenient. Getting access to the property is very easy and straightforward.  Beds were comfortable, kitchen has all the necessities.  We were traveling with a senior who has issues with steps and this property made our stay very easy for her.  Thanks Amanda."
32133603,457283766,2019-05-23,63949218,Michelle,"Clean, convenient, quiet, cozy.  Everything you want in a home away from home. Easy to find and close to everything. Can get as much or as little rushing water noise from creekside windows in both bedrooms. Makes for greatly restful sleep. Not too foofy, very minimalistic which we loved. Mr had spacious table inside and outside for working remotely. Great place, recommend for 2 couples, family and level entry for mobility challenged.  Each br has an adjoining bath. Just enough space and primacy for 2-4 people. Recommended."
32133603,457724891,2019-05-24,153830730,Wayne,"The apartment was great!

We loved the balcony overlooking the creek!"

32133603,461050934,2019-05-30,68902419,Margie/Richard,"Amanda's place is becoming my home-away-from-home place when I need to work in Salem. It has everything I need for a comfortable stay, close to the offices I need to visit, close to downtown and the yoga studio I enjoy. The condo is clean and has a wonderful patio to sit and listen to the creek and relax after a long day of work. Amanda is quick to respond and take care of any needs!"

Easy walk to downtown yet you feel like you’re in a tropical oasis overlooking the creek. 

The condo has all the basics and makes one’s  visit easy and comfortable. 

Looking forward to our next stay!"

32133603,475099692,2019-06-23,200658456,Maryanne And Chalie,We didn’t stay at Amanda’s due to a chemical smell. Amanda was gracious and gave us a full refund.
32133603,477164625,2019-06-27,233329738,LeighLee,This is an amazing gem of a place. It accommodated our larger size family and also allows us to entertain our local family for breakfast. We absolutely loved the sleeping to the sounds of the creek flowing by and having our meals on the patio with the creek flowing next to us. Amanda  was always available and willing to help us with any questions. Loved this place !!
32133603,488896106,2019-07-15,64086027,Kerry,"Spacious condo with many wonderful features! We especially enjoyed walking to many of the downtown sights: restaurants, shopping, and events that Salem offers. The creek side location is beautiful and  the condo was dog friendly which meant we could ALL enjoy Salem:)! Since we stayed for two weeks, I also appreciated the laundry room!"
32133603,489962045,2019-07-17,4169516,Carmen,"The house was clean and spacious.  Plenty of extra towels and linens.  The back deck by the creek is a huge plus. To be able to have breakfast listening to the water running and the birds chirping was priceless.  
Location is perfect if you don’t want to drive around, lot of places were within walking distance.  We did not walk, but the area seems safe.
When you get to the house, make sure you follow the instructions Amanda gives you to find the parking spot.  It is very tricky and I didn’t walk to the alley to see what it actually looked like, so it was hard for me to find it."
32133603,493612574,2019-07-22,7436419,Aaron,Incredible balcony and creek.  Makes a wonderful natural grey noise for sleeping.   Feels like your in the mountains.  Great place for my dog and I.  Hosts made sure I could park my tall van.
32133603,501525418,2019-08-03,5547648,Barbara,"The apartment is very spacious.  It is very well located and less than a mile from a mall, a movie theater, and a farmer's market.  It also is close to several restaurants.  I would stay here again when I'm in Salem and would recommend it to others."
32133603,506556652,2019-08-10,23629070,Xiyuan,Thank you Amanda for hosting us!

32133603,548068908,2019-10-16,298332571,Tara,"The location was convenient, the beds were comfortable but it smelt like an old smokey or musty hotel room.  Good for the value but be aware that it does smell."
32133603,552471316,2019-10-21,50784005,Tara,"The apartment was lovely and exceptionally clean. I was able to hear the creek outside my window while I was falling asleep which was especially nice. The gas fireplace was very cozy on a blustery day, and there were plenty of extra pillows, blankets, and towels provided as well!"
32133603,553683745,2019-10-24,27847375,Julie,"Amanda’s condo is spacious, clean and well equipped. Our visit was short, just one night. We really appreciated the coffee and filters so we could get our fix before heading out! The view of the creek and the trees in their fall colors was lovely."
32133603,555617856,2019-10-27,263511019,Jacob,Great place to stay in Salem
32133603,558218622,2019-11-02,18954036,Matthew,Hosts reply fast if something is needed or needs to be corrected. The place was super chill and relaxing. The creek is really peaceful. If you are a smoker the alley leads to a good walk around the streets. All in all a happy experience with these hosts.
32133603,563074546,2019-11-11,238127924,Bettina,Very roomy and accommodating
32133603,565772627,2019-11-17,28406814,Beverly,"Amanda's condo on the creek was a comfortable and ideally situated home-away-from-home for our friends and us. The condo is nicely remodeled and roomy, and the back deck is a perfect morning coffee retreat, as the sounds of the creek are such a relaxing backdrop! Amanda is easy to communicate with, and responded to our questions promptly and courteously."
32133603,567146149,2019-11-21,288659630,Lanelle,Everything is perfect! Full kitchen plenty of dishes to cook. The sound of the creek is so peaceful. Condo is much bigger than i expected very home feeling and we will be back very soon. Thank you for going above and beyond with this air bnb

32133603,585388545,2019-12-31,4057267,Matt,"Our stay at Amanda’s was a great place for hanging with family.  Everyone had their own space but there was plenty of room to hang out as a group.  We enjoyed being close to downtown and how easy it was to get around.  We enjoyed the fireplace,too.  Great spot!"
32133603,593392421,2020-01-15,142307475,Erik,"Simple, clean, and close to the Capitol. Good value."
32133603,594089483,2020-01-17,318079981,Leah,"This place was located walking distance from Downtown Salem, which made it super easy to get around. I was there for business and we did not have any issues."
32133603,615308997,2020-03-07,263252777,Edward,Very  adequate  and  comfortable accommodations  with  easy  access  to Willamette University (our destination).

32133603,620787455,2020-03-24,35812368,Lois,Amanda's place is very clean with great touches to make you feel at home! Would stay here again.
32318245,419805494,2019-03-04,23152933,Jenny,This space was fantastic. The furniture was super comfy and we had plenty of space to land in. We appreciated the space between bedrooms and the kitchen was well appointed. It was convenient to downtown Salem and the privacy was great. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Salem.
32318245,424435052,2019-03-16,191594094,Margaret,"Lillian's cottage was perfect for us!  We were visiting the area (where we had previously lived and worked) so we knew the location would be perfect.  Easy trips to the south, west, and north were important and this location fit the bill.  What we didn't know about the location was the quality of the dog park and overall park just a minute or two away.  What a beautiful park it is, we spent a lot of time with our dog there. A walk along the Willamette River restores body and soul.

Location aside, the cottage was very appealing.   The house has tremendous character and charm and it has been very wonderfully appointed with decoration and function.  The kitchen works great, the technology works wonderfully.  It is spacious and cheerful, one feels at home right away.

Lillian was a very gracious hostess, we couldn't recommend this any more highly."
32318245,425673461,2019-03-18,244790944,Ryan,"This is a fantastic house! Very comfortable and lots of space. Beds were cozy. it’s in a very private area, but you’re also close to downtown. We appreciated the extra thought she put into making us feel at home ( the chocolates and snack) . Would definitely stay here again if we’re in the area!! "
32318245,428299663,2019-03-24,51334510,Barbara,"A wonderful home.  A lot thought was put in to making this a home away from home.  The owners thought of everything you may need and also every comfort.  The kitchen was very well stocked with everything for cooking meals,  It was very stylish and my 12 year grandson loved the loft. With the bedrooms on each side of the home it was private but yet it was open and spacious."
32318245,429702800,2019-03-28,46774039,Scott,Great quiet spot to spread out and relax. Lillian and Joshua are the perfect hosts and could not have been more gracious.
32318245,430505677,2019-03-30,1121098,Kai,Josh’s place is beautiful and spacious! It was also thoughtfully equipped. We had a nice stay. Thank you.
32318245,433072090,2019-04-05,23152933,Jenny,This was our second stay and it was great. We love the space and the separate and spacious bedrooms worked really well with our young kids who go to bed early. The location has worked well for us when we visit Salem too.
32318245,434869486,2019-04-08,99530132,Susan,"The cottage was clean and nicely laid out where you could have some privacy, but also common areas where all guest could comfortably come together and play games or hang out.  The place is also pretty private with no neighbors right next door.  

I would definitely stay here again."
32318245,435215102,2019-04-09,242787393,Molly,Perfect location! Great for our family with two young kiddos to get away. Very central location and close to Minto Brown Park which was a big hit with the kids and our dog. Nicely appointed with everything we needed for our stay. We will definitely be back! Thank you Josh & Lilian!
32318245,436263645,2019-04-12,41951592,Janeen,this is a nice quiet place.  the hosts are very helpful.  its close to parks and town and museums
32318245,437519534,2019-04-14,162277566,Cassie,The place is very clean and quite spacious. Lillian was quick and friendly on replies. And we had a great (short) visit and would highly recommend for a group in Salem.

32318245,450195181,2019-05-08,74058270,Michele,Great stay. Cute and stylish. Very quiet. We had a temporary problem with the WiFi and Lillian and Josh were really fast to investigate and fix. Great directions to find the place and check in process. Will definitely stay again.
32318245,453026717,2019-05-14,156056144,Cindy,Lillian is a wonderful hostess and we hope to stay again. The house is clean and well furnished. All you need for a cozy stay over a weekend or longer.
32318245,454191038,2019-05-17,55550551,Rachel,Very clean! Overall a great experience for our stay in Salem!
32318245,456132377,2019-05-20,202893803,Kim,"This house is in a great location (read the directions provided to find it).  Close to everything we needed and well appointed.  While the house has easy access for older occupants, there is a step up into one of the bedrooms and there isn’t a walk-in shower.  Otherwise roomy, clean and plenty of parking.  We didn’t bring a dog but the field out back makes it easy to provide some outdoor exercise for a pooch."
32318245,459066380,2019-05-26,118091059,Sarah,"Lillian has done a fantastic job making this space so cute, inviting, and cozy. The huge couch in the living room was more than enough room for my family to comfortably have a movie night. The light and soft paint colors make the space feel huge, and the lovely touches like flowers and throw blankets make the space so inviting. We loved having a keurig, and the kitchen had all the tools we needed. This will be our airbnb every time we visit family in Salem! :)"
32318245,459824878,2019-05-27,90055389,Kelley,"Perfect space for our group! The place was clean, spacious and comfortable!"

32318245,466951012,2019-06-09,249768235,Connie,Lillian was very responsive and nice about everything. Just know that you do not have TV unless you have Netflix or etc. We also had a big ant problem which someone would have to know about. It was a nice place other than those things.
32318245,467709061,2019-06-10,109515384,Levi,"Nice house, has everything in."
32318245,469017592,2019-06-13,74058270,Michele,Second stay and hope to be back. Quiet and comfortable. Great place to stay.
32318245,475696047,2019-06-24,249121313,Susan,"Fantastic place! Clean, convenient to lots of places  and very spacious. We stayed for two weeks with our 4 1/2 year old granddaughter who lives in Dallas Oregon she did not want us to leave. We highly recommend this beautiful home."
32318245,481922968,2019-07-05,62678713,Arpit,Very nice place and easy to find and check in.
32318245,486461224,2019-07-12,123932425,Helen,A great place to stay! Quiet area but easy access to so much. The host did a great job of making sure our needs were met! Fantastic!
32318245,488949988,2019-07-15,254555745,Robin,This home has a very comfortable and private home away from home setting. It is very clean and has alot of room for guests.
32318245,494170296,2019-07-23,1403322,Shani,We had a very comfortable stay.  It's super quiet and close to everything.   Communication was great and a nice large space.  Thanks Lillian!
32318245,495218655,2019-07-25,28655434,Nathan,Good place to stay.  Close to amenities but still quiet.
32318245,498964246,2019-07-30,54800516,Matthew,If you're looking for a clean and very well located place to stay while in Salem this is the place! Close to a lot of places to eat and downtown Salem. Thanks Lillian
32318245,514214589,2019-08-20,191594094,Margaret,"This was our second time staying in Lillian's place.   We love it there!  While the location fits our needs wonderfully, with so many choices we wouldn't have stayed again if the house itself wasn't so nice.  It is quiet, roomy, warm (for March when we were there first) and cool (for those 90 degree days that we had in August!)  Everything you need is there, there is plenty of space for families and/or guests.  For those with dogs (like us) the dog park down the road just a mile or so is fabulous.  If you don't have dogs, the park is still a wonderful place to visit, miles and miles of trails for hiking and biking right along the Willamette River.

We have traveled all over the West and this is one of our favorite homes, if not the favorite, that we have rented."
32318245,516002199,2019-08-23,170553258,Dina,"The cottage well clean and well cared for. It’s close enough to town and Willamette University (10 minutes), but far enough to be very peaceful and quiet. The separated sleeping areas were a bonus for us, as they allowed a lot of privacy. We enjoyed our stay."
32318245,517666061,2019-08-25,265516433,Douglas,"Stylish, clean and comfortable, we had a great one night stay."
32318245,520043005,2019-08-29,52707377,Jane,Conveniently located to everything you could need.
32318245,522262317,2019-09-01,122528162,Gloria,A very spacious cottage.  Lillian responded quickly to my inquiries.
32318245,524307258,2019-09-05,274311001,Holly,"Lillian's place was cute, we enjoyed our time there.  If you know smart TV, you'll be ok.  AC didn't cool the whole place very well though.  But it was so convenient to friends we were visiting, so worked for us."
32318245,526965007,2019-09-09,160181216,Linda,"Lovely place in a nice quiet location.  Just be careful not to lock yourself out like I did late at night in the rain. The door locks automatically when closed, and it is very easy to do."
32318245,572456225,2019-12-02,76661950,Suzanne,"We had a fantastic time at Lillian’s. There’s a lovely park and trail up the street, which we frequented each morning. The home was spotless and very nicely decorated. Thanks again, Lillian!"
32318245,585352709,2019-12-31,113904696,Connie,"Comfortable cottage in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood of Salem.  The house is located behind a small, 2-business office complex, not far from Downtown Salem.  The attorney's office and small management office will not affect your stay.  They are quiet only there during business hours.  It is also very convenient for shopping.  We were there for the birth of our Grandchild and it was very close to the Salem Hospital, which made it very convenient for us to go back and forth.  The price is more than fair for what the cottage offers.  There are two nice size bedrooms.  The Master is large and has a large sofa sectional to relax with a large television on the wall.  There is no cable TV but there are videos and both TV's are Smart TV's so if you have any streaming services, it will work fine. The Master bath is large but does not have a shower/bath.  You will have to use the second bathroom in the house to bathe.  The second Bedroom is nice size and is located on the opposite side of the Living Room, which is nice for couples and children.  It is nice to have a washer/dryer in the house.  There is a small kitchen but very useful.  We stayed in the house for three weeks and it was good for cooking simple meals.  I would recommend this house for two couples or a small family.  The host, Lillian, is very attentive and helpful.  She is quick to respond to your questions and helpful if you need anything.  We would definitely stay in this home again and recommend it."
32318245,588544381,2020-01-04,50949160,Paige,"Great place, close to downtown and easy to get to everything in Salem."
32318245,592704293,2020-01-13,255845032,Eunice,"We loved everything about the cottage, it’s bigger than we expected! Very clean, very cozy. Each room and bathroom comes with heaters which is great!"
32318245,594092340,2020-01-17,28345669,Chris,The Croisan Cottage was an amazing home with very stylish furnishings. Lillian was very responsive to any needs during the stay. I would recommend this home to anyone looking for a quiet and and serene location.
32318245,598728540,2020-01-27,163843937,Doyce,"This wonderful house is spotless, roomy and conveniently located.  Well equipped kitchen. Kids will enjoy a special place at the top of the stairs!  The neighborhood is very quiet with ample parking.  Owners address questions in a timely manner.  The parks nearby are a great place to take a walk."
32318245,600058181,2020-01-31,10337783,Chandra,"Perfect location near beautiful parks and hiking. The Kays are delightful and their place is spotless, tasteful decor and best of all comfy."
32318245,619241195,2020-03-16,115851398,Leilani,"Lillian was a great host! She responded quickly and was very helpful. Her place was beautiful, lots of thoughtful touches, clean and exactly as pictured. The third room was an upstairs loft/attic area that we didn't end up using, but the rest of the house was roomy and very comfortable. Lots of parking and nice outdoors area too. Would definitely stay again."
32318245,621070227,2020-03-27,293908848,Debra,Great place to stay. Comfortable living & dining space for the family to gather. Beautiful area of Salem.

32318245,625443564,2020-05-20,327222915,Daniel,"Lillian’s place is very peaceful and beautiful. I had a long stay and it was very accommodating. Good stay for work, beautiful touches all around the cottage, and a lot of space to park. They have everything you could need for a nice stay.  10/10 would recommend . Only complaint was for a long stay the old dining set that was there it broke and being so close to nature ants were also a small issue."
32318245,628954041,2020-06-11,342832976,End,Take pictures on arriving so you don't get charged four previous damages.. !
32318245,630606278,2020-06-19,348919261,Todd,Understand that you are close to nature so you will find ants and spiders and the likes.
32318245,632083056,2020-06-25,171151521,Robert,amazing.
32318245,634310658,2020-07-03,182696488,Crystal,"This is a great place to stay. It is tucked behind an office, so it is very secluded and private...zero road noise and you can see the trains as they go by! Read the description carefully, I thought this was a 2 bath, but it is really a 1.5 (Website hidden by Airbnb) one shower."
32318245,635734134,2020-07-07,348607392,Denise,"The home had a lot of space and had everything we needed! Close to restaurants, grocery stores and parks. I would definitely book Lillian's home again if I am in the area!"

32640764,434457850,2019-04-07,22124094,Janeth,"My husband and I are from Eugene and had a concert to attend in Salem on Friday and decided to stay the whole weekend to wine tour on Saturday. This home is impeccable! Check-in was quick and easy. Everything worked perfectly and was like new. This home had everything you could possibly imagine. Very impressed by the little things, for example, makeup remover wipes. 
Connie was very responsive and overall amazing!"
32640764,443816536,2019-04-26,17624285,Taylor,Lots of nice touches throughout the house. Locate at quiet neighbourhood. Connie is very responsive and communicative during stay. The house is perfect for large parties and very nicely equipped. We are very happy with the stay.
32640764,448987291,2019-05-05,99012938,Resa,"Where do I start?  Connie was even more amazing than her beautiful home, and her home is immaculate.  There was not one thing that we needed, that wasn’t already there, and then some.  Her response time, even after 12:30am was just about immediate.  Our stay at Connie’s made our reunion with family & graduation celebration all the more special.  Now looking for a reason to return.  Great memories for sure!!"
32640764,452229138,2019-05-12,254609494,Jon,"Place is as advertised, a very lovely home and has a peaceful vibe. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if back in area"

If you’re traveling with two people and both like to read before bed, you may have to switch off each night for who has the bedside table with the lamp as there is only one proper nightstand  with a lamp. The other side has a lovely bench but no light so it’s a little dark to read from just the lamp light. However, there’s always the overhead lights you’d just have to get out of bed to turn them off."

We were running extremely late for check-in and Shana made accommodations to make the process easy and pain free. I only wish we had even more time to enjoy the thoughtfully decorated space but we will definitely look her way again if we stay in Salem. If you're reading this and visit the area, definitely check out Word of Mouth Bistro - as the name might imply, it's worth it."

I definitely recommend this host and location!"

33528630,594149291,2020-01-17,27132432,Brian,Wonderful garage with all the space and nice touches you could ask for. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at.
33528630,598268988,2020-01-26,27558839,Polly,The garage is the cutest space! Comfy bed. Would definitely stay here again if in Salem!
33528630,600021859,2020-01-31,75979244,Jacey,"I had a lovely stay here. I had my own parking spot, access to Hulu and Netflix, the kitchen was large, and there were even snacks and breakfast foods. 

The accommodation has all the comforts of home. The furnishings were clean, the host very kind, and the neighborhood laid back and quiet. 

I would absolutely recommend this place, it is the perfect space for an Airbnb."
33528630,601178553,2020-02-02,247648741,Amanda,The Garage is an excellent space! Kitchenette was cute and had anything we would need! Had a great nights sleep and even watched an episode on Netflix before bed! Definitely would recommend!
33528630,601835629,2020-02-04,11579167,Erin,"Shana's place, a renovated garage, is well-located near the Capitol and offers a good bed, a clean space, nice towels and a large and comfortable shower.  The toaster oven and coffee maker were nice and the Wifi was solid. Bring slippers since the floor is poured concrete and pretty cold.

The host could work on communication with guests, the dog run aromas and heat level.  In what I hope was a fluke, she called law enforcement when she saw (registered guest) in the backyard waiting for the key or further instructions, without calling me to confirm identity first. Police came out and asked for ID and proof of invitation. This was distressing and really put a shadow on the whole experience after a long day of work and travel. Shana and Airbnb are working on it, and I trust this won't happen to people in the future."
33528630,602422609,2020-02-06,185970366,Dewey,great place  to get a nice quiet rest while in salem..

She was prompt in her communications, flexible about my need to reschedule and overall a pleasure to deal with. My kitty and I LOVED our stay!  Highly recommended."

The atmosphere is calm and refreshing. The location is great.  The side patio was a bonus we weren't expecting and it was so nice to sit out in the morning and enjoy our coffee. Our 2 kids loved it and enjoyed the games provided. Overall amazing experience and we will definitelybe back.

He was a kind gentleman. He had welcoming soft quiet music playing in the living room. The room was in a separate area so it is private. The bed was very comfortable and the projector worked well for me to watch something’s on Netflix. Parking on the street was easy and right in front of his house. The neighborhood was good. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."

I did not use either of which but these could be very big points for you that may set it apart from other nearby listings. Lars is very nice and welcoming. He even came out to greet me. You are a very short drive away from just about anything you may need (food, stores, etc).  I would recommend him to anyone looking for a place to stay in Salem."

Lars gave me the run down and left me alone which I appreciated. I came in late and had to leave early in the morning.  No hassle. Solid experience."

His golden retriever puppy, Jadzia, very much the lady of the house. She is sweet, rambunctious, and entertaining - I loved her! But if you aren’t a dog fan, stay elsewhere. The location was perfect for my quick trip to Willamette University to visit my son. I would definitely stay with him again next time I’m in Salem."

33564568,661317702,2020-09-06,8005695,John,"I’ve stayed at Lars’ place several times now, it’s always a great experience. The space is clean and quiet, bed is comfy, and Jadzia the golden retriever is always happy to have a guest around. No worries about dog hair in the room, she’s very good at waiting in the hall. Individual air conditioning (and a space heater, future proofing here) for the room, though I never needed it even in the summer heat. Neighborhood is convenient to all of Salem, street is quiet and parking is so easy that I never thought to mention it before. Outstanding stay, always my first choice when I’m in town!"
33564568,670250489,2020-10-02,56611253,Scott,Great host and great dogs
33686883,439855722,2019-04-19,77840459,Bridget,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
33686883,448946955,2019-05-05,48293401,Laura,Angela was a great host and we loved the space and location!
33686883,452292099,2019-05-12,1115512,Louis,Lovely rustic setting tucked away in the woods with garden grounds and quiet surroundings. Comfortable bed and living area. Bathroom provided all the necessary accommodations. It's a treasure of a find for a getaway weekend. Close to wineries and local shops just minutes away including a breakfast café and coffee shop.
33686883,454629356,2019-05-18,169390049,Karly,Beautiful place to stay
33686883,460260402,2019-05-28,52480029,Wayne,Beautiful location but it is a little rustic
33686883,466957629,2019-06-09,113403195,Wes,Add the bunkhouse to your Salem list! It’s unique and surrounded with opportunities for outdoor fun. Angela is an excellent host! We enjoyed our stay :)
33686883,479275091,2019-06-30,213624901,Cheryl,"Quiet, private space on an estate filled with lovely gardens.  A rural feel just minutes from downtown.  Microwave, fridge and Keurig, but limited space for meal prep.  Make a salad or coffee and cereal and eat at the table on the porch, surrounded by blooms, birds and bunnies!  Large bathroom, comfy bed!  Walk, bike or drive to Minto-Brown Island Park next door, and maybe continue on the paths all the way to Riverfront Park!"
33686883,481394470,2019-07-04,40809084,Laurie,"This place embodies my favorite part of Air bnb:  a very unique lodging that gives you an experience you would never have in a hotel.   While the bunkhouse property gives you the feeling of being in a huge park,  it is only a few minutes from downtown Salem.   It's quiet, and lovely and serene.  An earlier review said that the room is quite rustic, and it IS, but in a beautiful authentic way!  That's what makes this stay special.  The owner lives in a separate house on the property, and I was lucky enough to meet her.  This is quite a special offering for those who like privacy in a beautiful setting."
33686883,484414842,2019-07-08,136265705,Kevin,"We enjoyed our stay! Close to everywhere you’ll want to be, but far enough to enjoy some quiet relaxing time"

33686883,643057114,2020-07-26,148716216,Kelsey,This place is the most quaint and cute little bunkhouse. There is so much you can do that you won't be able to get it all done in one weekend. Angela was incredible with her communication to us and so friendly. It was like we had known her for years. Highly recommend staying here!

They go above and beyond what most hosts have done in the past (like bring an unprepared desert dweller a pair of gloves) , and with a smile!"

I don't know what kind of mattress it is, but it's the best I've ever slept on.  The Little Blue House is very cute and just feels right.  I loved relaxing here at the end of a busy day.  The grocery store is a convenient walk away.    The neighborhood is very peaceful.  Everything important in Salem is close to this house.   I will stay here again on future visits to Salem."

Norma and Pete's place is newly renovated and was the perfect choice for our visit to Salem, Oregon. It's clean and decorated with lots of interesting Oregon memorabilia. The living room is open and inviting, the bedroom is cozy and comfortable, the kitchen is bright and decorated with colorful and fun touches. 
Norma met us at check-in and was lovely. 
We were visiting family in Salem, and this cottage was perfect for my husband and I. It is close to the supermarket, downtown Salem is a few minutes by car and its centrally located for any trips to the coast, the mountains, the waterfalls or a day in Portland. We loved this cottage and hated to leave."

I am so thankful that Norma was able to accommodate the new dates. I am so grateful to have had a safe and clean place to stay while picking up my daughter. Norma was kind, responsive and helpful during this difficult time. The little Blue House had all the comforts of home, an excellent location, and was so comfortable, and since we were sheltering in place, we became very familiar with the Little Blue House! 
Thank you Norma for the home away from home and your kindness."

I stayed the month of August in her house and felt cold in the basement room where I stayed, but she provided an electric heater for me. Evelyn is accesible and caring. You will enjoy staying at her place."
34158635,539112926,2019-09-30,8367187,Patricia,"Evelyn is an excellent host. The room almost feels like a separate apartment with a separate sitting room, makeshift kitchen and dining area, and huge bedroom with 2 chairs and table. Also, a nice patio in her great garden backyard. It’s cleaned once a week and very comfortable. Plus, Evelyn brings in fresh flowers from her garden often."
34158635,557315669,2019-10-31,8367187,Patricia,"Evelyn and her AirBnb space is great, always everything I could ask for. Feels like my own place."
34158635,571120596,2019-11-30,8367187,Patricia,"This is the end of my 3-month stay with Evelyn and everything has been perfect throughout my stay. Evelyn is very friendly, thoughtful, and helpful.  Definitely would stay here again!"
34158635,587925336,2020-01-03,242364215,Dyshay,"Perfect location, perfect host. Great space with easy assess. Just great all around! I’ll be staying again actually."
34158635,594125116,2020-01-17,242364215,Dyshay,Thanks too the amazing host for the space and amazing hospitality but I’ll be staying again as my work contract extends into the future.
34158635,596124746,2020-01-21,242364215,Dyshay,"Stay few different times over past month absolutely wonderful host, perfect work space and sleep space! I appreciated it all! Will stay again down the line. Thanks again!"
34158635,621938954,2020-04-06,8367187,Patricia,"I’ve stayed at many AIRBNB‘s around the world but never found one as comfortable and accommodating as Evelyn‘s place. It’s almost like having your own apartment. The bed was comfortable, there’s a sitting area,  almost separate kitchen area, and she thought of all the special touches like fresh flowers every few days, warm fresh baked cookies, and pleasant conversations."
34158635,633856908,2020-07-01,297749870,Joey,"Place was great, and the host's are very welcoming and respecting of space. I would recommend this place to anyone."
34158635,635556783,2020-07-06,346565862,Edie,Expect quiet and tranquility and cleanliness when you stay at Evelyn’s she is lovely and her place is immaculate~
34158635,652465383,2020-08-16,64088215,Ian,"Evelyn's place was great value for staying in South Salem! It is relatively close to downtown and to some of the amenities on Commercial street. The room itself was very comfortable, and the kitchenette area had everything I needed for the weekend."
34158635,657965439,2020-08-29,27236262,Thibaud,"Evelyn was very welcoming even though I arrived a bit later than expected. I have never seen such a clean room (very clean towels also) and felt very safe about covid. The bed sheets are so comfortable and soft ! I definitely recommend, thank you!"
34158635,664114555,2020-09-13,148626900,Jamey,"Evelyn is a wonderful host, and the room was perfect. I enjoyed the quiet space and the backyard garden. I highly recommend this Airbnb."
34158635,671228431,2020-10-04,280742596,Sidney,GREAT PLACE !
34393013,448916756,2019-05-05,241348742,Dan,Great space in a lovely location. Evening walk around the neighborhood was particularly pleasant.
34393013,449498439,2019-05-06,185842,Lynn M,Nice place
34393013,450531974,2019-05-09,241765394,Miichele,"An uptown feel, and a great value, Greatly priced, and great amenities.  This is a place to stay for a night, week or month that will surely feel like home."
34393013,450983740,2019-05-10,259695338,Haley,Wonderful place but there’s construction going on in the building and they start very early
34393013,452746538,2019-05-13,63290458,Adam,"The stay here was prefect for our visit to Willamette University. It is an easy walk to the school, downtown, and there is grocery store right around the corner.
Everything seems to have been newly remodeled and was very quiet for being so close to downtown.
It is a very simple setup, but a great place from which to launch out and see Salem!"
34393013,454221161,2019-05-17,157085717,Brian,"The location was great and Troy was very responsive.  The place was clean and comfortable, I would definitely stay again.
Thanks,
Brian"
34393013,456900481,2019-05-22,8709619,Eduardo,Lovely design all around . The place is nicely appointed with new furnishings . It was a little sparse for my taste could benefit from something on the walls etc . Liz was very Responsive since I had a little trouble finding the entry details. I thought the cleaning fee was a bit high for one night compared to other abb places. And would have liked a little more comforts — ie there was good coffee but no cream or even sugar. Also I was perplexed by the lack of tea/hot water kettle — using a pot was ok but rather inconvenient. Also couldn’t figure out the heater which seemed to be functioning but never raised the heat .
34393013,458225705,2019-05-25,228484708,Jon,Very nice place
34393013,459681130,2019-05-27,57065622,Rene,"This place has potential if host follows-through on communication; if keyless lock on main door works, since it was unlocked on each time I stayed there; and if the entire place is cleaned."
34393013,462113243,2019-06-01,213624901,Cheryl,"Troy’s place is as described, although still walkable,  not as close to shopping and dining as I expected.  Washer and dryer is great if you need them.  Kitchen has necessities, but no extras.  Stylish and clean!  Good for single or couple."
34393013,464465378,2019-06-05,72798095,Brianna,Amazing stay here! We felt very welcome & the hosts made sure to check that we were enjoying our stay!
34393013,465431914,2019-06-07,230251664,Melanie,Amazing apartment super close to downtown! We stayed just for a night but loved how comfy the bed and couch were!
34393013,465948799,2019-06-08,260667805,Kayley,"Troy's condo in Salem was beautiful, sparkling clean, and very conveniently located to downtown, the Capital and Willamette University. The space is beautifully furnished, instructions for entering the complex were clear and helpful and overall it was a great experience staying there."
34393013,466986164,2019-06-09,80239712,Ziv,Great Airbnb!
34393013,471986718,2019-06-18,111021516,Allison,"Pros: Clean apartment, newer furniture & appliances

-sliding glass door unlocked upon arrival
-WiFi but no password provided

34393013,476239874,2019-06-25,260279723,Ulric,Great spot. Well maintained and at a fair price.
34393013,477727162,2019-06-28,261575796,Brad,Lovely little place. Thanks.
34393013,479334520,2019-06-30,58774431,Martin,"The place is clean and furnished in a minimalist fashion. It has everything you need. The host communicates quickly. We enjoyed staying here.

There is an awesome breakfast spot 4-5 blocks away -- Sassy Onion. I tasted the best breakfast burrito ever there. It's certainly worth a visit."
34393013,484893561,2019-07-09,49217254,Linda,"My family and I had a wonderful time staying at this Airbnb. The place was VERY CLEAN and modern. Everything that was described in the Airbnb was provided. What I didn't notice before booking is that this Airbnb does not provide a microwave, which was not too much an inconvenience since we ate out almost every day. Also, the sofa bed was the only sitting area in the ""living room"" besides some chairs, which was a little uncomfortable when my family and I had down time and wanted to ""hangout"" in the apartment. The sofa bed and the bed in the bedroom were both comfortable to sleep on. The television provided was a lot smaller than I expected it to be, but it had Roku installed to it and gave us access to Netflix and Hulu. Our favorite part about this apartment was the bathroom, the shower was amazing and the shampoo and conditioner that were provided smelled wonderful. The washer and dryer were a major plus to have in the apartment as we were able to laundry everyday. The location was great, just a few minutes away from downtown, though there was some construction happening nearby almost every night which kept waking us up. 
Nevertheless, we would definitely consider staying at this location again!"
34393013,486471272,2019-07-12,5018263,Laura,"This place has a great location, easy check-in, and was nice and clean. Elizabeth was very kind to come by and bring us a few things that needed stocking without us even asking. We would stay here again, for sure."
34393013,493651059,2019-07-22,150156861,Destiney,"The only major downfall for our stay was that the check in process took longer than we expected since there was a mix up with the key cards and we had to contact the host to figure out how to get inside the building since the keycard for our unit was not inside the designated lock box. There was the question of whether the other Airbnb unit in the building had the same code as ours which was a concern for us considering (had someone been staying in the second unit) they could access our unit while we were gone. Highly advised the host to make sure that wasn’t the case as it is not very secure. The only other downside was that there was a dustpan full of dirt left right inside the front door like someone forgot to dump it out. The kitchen was a nice amenity, as well as the location and air conditioning, which was an added plus, especially coming from the desert where air conditioning is a ‘must have’ in every home.
Troy’s home has a modern and simple aesthetic, was comfy, and was close to downtown Salem."
34393013,495245766,2019-07-25,178701548,Drew,"This is a very clean space, although the couch is not the most comfy thing in the world this apartment has all the basic you need for a night or two!"
34393013,497793736,2019-07-28,77700693,Jonathan,Great place to stay for short or long stay! Highly recommended!
34393013,504443594,2019-08-07,7805901,Eric,"This place is large, super convenient to downtown salem and the courthouses, and very clean.  It is a bit sparsely furnished, but workable.  The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that construction was going on in the building (sounded like the apartment upstairs, but also in the hallways) starting at 7 AM.  Other than that it was quiet.  I suspect the construction will be over soon or already is."
34393013,507513917,2019-08-11,58010551,Robert,"Awesome place, clean, good location, comfortable."
34393013,508367352,2019-08-12,165838497,Nancy,Beautifully redone interior.   Comfortable beds. Great shower!
34393013,510174458,2019-08-15,175847204,Ashley,"Great place to stay! We loved the location so much- we basically walked everywhere. Also nice that they had a full kitchen and cooking utensils and pots and pans, enjoyed being able to cook our own meals while we stayed there."
34393013,511730669,2019-08-17,61294729,Kain,Fast response on questions. And everything was spot on for the description!
34393013,515350007,2019-08-22,150643638,Michael,"The apartment is newly remodeled, with fresh fixtures and major kitchen appliances. Important during the summer months, there is central air conditioning. As a guest, you have access to a parking spot, and there is an elevator to take you to your floor. The place is very well located, within an easy walk to the center of town and Willamette University. The hosts were super responsive and even shipped me the laptop charger I left behind.

The only negative aspect of our experience had to do with ability to get a good night's sleep. The bed, or more specifically, the mattress, was very uncomfortable, and there was loud machinery noise throughout most of the night. I am not sure whether the hosts have any control over the noise, but I hope they would consider investing in a better mattress, this would be a truly amazing place to stay then."
34393013,518988808,2019-08-27,282568237,Hannah,"Clean, convenient and everything it advertises itself to be. Small note that there is no microwave, but we had a stove and fridge and everything else so it was of no real consequence. Would absolutely stay here again."
34393013,522150736,2019-09-01,66035410,Natalie,Beautiful space that will feel like your home away from home. Walking distance to many downtown areas. Sparkling clean and the host gets back to you quickly should you have any questions. Couldn’t ask for more!

Thank you! We definitely recommend!"
34393013,527817074,2019-09-11,9208993,Dennis,Great!
34393013,531539448,2019-09-17,194417428,Elle,"The unit is advertised accurately: updated, clean, and simple. My check-in process was not ideal, as the unit was not turned over since the last guest and I walked into a dirty place. Elizabeth was quick to remedy the situation and was prompt in her communication. Hopefully, I was the anomaly in this experience. The remainder of my stay was pleasant and I enjoyed the location being in walking distance to a grocery store and coffee shop. I did find the door lock to be confusing at times (it has to be locked from the outside). I did make the recommendation to add a secondary lock (e.g., dead bolt, top chain lock) to increase security and confirmation of the door being secure. Overall"
34393013,535124667,2019-09-23,6878134,Matthew,"Clean, good price, and centrally-located.  We were happy with our stay.  Thanks!"
34393013,539104596,2019-09-30,94874443,Larry,Clean but small.  Well located if you’re visiting Willamette.  Had some trouble with the heat otherwise it was a good stay.

34393013,569780024,2019-11-27,9017773,Nick,The apartment was very nice. Trendy and new with lots of space. The process to get in and check out was seamlessly easy. They left us a complimentary bottle of wine and snack which was above and beyond. There is a reserved parking spot which was also nice. We were close enough to downtown that we could walk to all the stores and restaurants even in the cold weather. I recommend this apartment.
34393013,571901632,2019-12-01,25965177,Stefanie,"Cute, clean + a great location. Easy walk downtown and you get to pass the Capitol building on the way. Plus it's close to the popular breakfast spot Word of Mouth. Liz was in contact right away and leading up to our stay. Would stay again!"

34393013,580999661,2019-12-23,61967597,Jill And Gregg,"Very clean and conveniently located apartment on the edge of downtown. Some nice extras like wine, snack and mints. However, the decor is very sparse/minimalist, and we found the bed, couch and rolling chair to be uncomfortable. We could also hear neighbors walking around, talking, brushing their teeth, etc."
34393013,584210650,2019-12-29,26874962,Ben,"Great place, very stylish and clean. The bed is a Full size, which might be a little small for two adults, depending on your preferences. Very close to the capital buildings. Host was very communicative and we had a great stay."

It has all new appliances in a very modern kitchen it was equipped with everything you might need to make meals. There were two small balconies to sit out and enjoy a cup of coffee. Communication was quick and easy and check in seamless. We loved how new the space was and also having a washer and dryer in the unit."
34393013,645302916,2020-08-01,328397060,James,"The location of the room is very good, you can walk to the supermarket in 3 minutes, the disadvantage is that the bed is not big, if it is two strong people, it would be a bit crowded. The sound insulation is not very good."

Good food in the area and a Safeway right across the street- even better, a kitchen you can cook in if you like. The condo was private, clean, nicely decorated, and all we could ask for. If we find ourselves in Salem again, this will defiantly be our go-to."

I would not hesitate to stay there again!

35466555,475699120,2019-06-24,51964219,Cheryl,This small but well equipped space was just what we needed. There was nothing that Lisa didn’t think of. She was available if we needed anything but not intrusive. Her place was spotless and tasteful. We had a great stay!

35466555,481427816,2019-07-04,134323987,Kc,"Absolutely loved this place! The communication from Lisa was easy and quick. As soon as you pull up to the house, the charm is screaming. The house has so much charter and so clean! 

The special little details from the personalized welcome sign, notes of where things are in the kitchen, the art station, the chocolates on the bed, fresh local strawberries, pancake/ waffle mix ready to go, and recommendations of locals places was amazing. I have not been anywhere else with this eye for detail. 

The pictures in the profile are spot on. 

Definitely on my favorites list! Highly recommended this rental!"
35466555,481975178,2019-07-05,1173537,Jeanine,Wonderful!
35466555,488857215,2019-07-15,87254606,Justine Elyse,"Lisa's cottage was fantastic. She left us notes to let us know how to use things and the personal touches (i.e. waffle mix and welcome sign) made the stay even warmer. While we didn't utilize the outdoor space, it's a gem, especially in the summer. Lisa was prompt in her responses and a great host."
35466555,491140682,2019-07-19,60077582,Sarah,"Lisa was an attentive and responsive host. The place was very clean, and Lisa made sure we felt welcome with little things like a welcome sign with our names on it.

35466555,491838077,2019-07-20,119361015,Jamie,"Lisa has an adorable private home. She adds the sweetest touches! Waffles ready to make for breakfast, an art area to draw/paint, and many notes around the home with helpful hints to navigate her amenities. Would highly recommend this space if staying in the Salem area. We had a lovely, restful time here."
35466555,495914891,2019-07-26,275363780,Ellyn,"This cottage is located in a quiet older neighborhood with beautiful majestic trees shading the street and homes. It is an  easy walk  downtown where we enjoyed dinner and strolling through the neighborhood and capitol.  In the morning, as we sat on the covered porch we were entertained by local creatures(birds and squirrels) playing and gathering twigs. It was so relaxing. The the host went over the top with fresh flowers in the rooms, fresh fruit for our breakfast, chocolates on the bed, wine, sparkling water, great toiletries in the bath, personal greetings and it is a  beautifully decorated cottage with  mature landscaping. Wonderful inside and out."
35466555,497777395,2019-07-28,7704529,Ed,"Lisa's description of her Airbnb is spot on.  If there are any surprises they are all positive extra special touches.  She has a charming little art area where she has provided a variety of art supplies to get in touch with your creative side. In the fridge was an already made up waffle mix, freshly cut berries, whipped cream, assorted yogurts, wine, and other assorted sundries.  There are adorable little handmade signs on the cupboards to let you know where everything is. The waffle maker works like a charm. There is a Keurig coffee maker and a variety of assorted coffees and teas. In the bedroom she has provided earplugs and eye masks if needed, but we found it to be very tranquil and earplugs weren't necessary. There is a nice rotating fan in the room that not only feels great but also adds a nice bit of white noise for a restful nights sleep. The bed was very comfortable. There was also an air conditioner in the living room. She even has a little cupboard in the backroom with extras of items you might have forgotten to bring, like toothbrushes, toothpaste, qtips, etc... If we are ever in need of an Airbnb in Salem again we would definitely check to see if Lisa had something available first."
35466555,499026063,2019-07-30,20404071,Nick,"This is an exceptional place to stay.  The property is well-represented by the photos, but these do not capture all of the little touches--wine, waffles, and a night-time chocolate.  These days, it's standard to give a place five stars if it meets expectations.  So I have to give this place a five star plus plus 5++!  Loved it."

35466555,508982568,2019-08-13,37839589,Renee,"This is a very special place!  There were lovely flowers in the house, and it was very neat & clean.  We were able to get this stay arranged on the same day as we needed it.  Lisa communicated promptly and effectively.  All the prep work for breakfast waffles was awaiting us in the refrigerator, with many topping choices - an unexpected perk.  There was cold water in the refrigerator as well.

Lisa left fresh fruit and waffle mix with all the fixings for breakfast. It was very close to great restaurants in downtown Salem and still only about 30 minutes away from Silver Creek Falls State Park. It's nestled in a quiet well taken care of neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again if we're ever in Salem.

We enjoyed sitting on the front porch, and the place was well appointed with everything you might need in the kitchen. The waffle bar set up made for a really fun and easy breakfast in the morning. The bathroom was tiny, but it had the most luxurious towels and nice bath products in the shower so we didn't mind at all!

35466555,669208264,2020-09-28,182108770,Peter,Traffic stay at Lisa‘s place. Easy to find and a breeze with the self check in. Very clean and a terrific modern kitchen with everything you need to cook. Will absolutely stay there again!
35466555,669687480,2020-09-30,369266966,Beth,"This was my first time at an Airbnb and any future ones I stay in will have a hard act to follow! The many little touches made me immediately feel at home and welcomed. It was a much-needed respite during a stressful time. I highly recommend the cottage if you are looking for a cozy, homey place.  I’m so happy I was able to stay here and you will, too!"
35466555,670226911,2020-10-02,369266966,Beth,"I loved all the personal touches Lisa had at this airbnb!  The bathroom itself was like a spa, with the bubble bath, candle, and large tub. The space was comfortable and welcoming. Lisa is a wonderful host!"
35466555,671223546,2020-10-04,45697491,Tim,Lisa's cottage is great for an intimate stay in Salem. I would recommend it for any single person or couple.
35466555,672423919,2020-10-08,236003376,Nicole,"Can’t say enough about how incredible this stay was! Lisa has put so much thought and care into making the space warm and welcoming. From the welcome sign, pre measured waffle mix,  fully stocked kitchen and tea and coffee station, to the adorable art desk in the back, we had such a cozy place to call home for a few days. Thank you for having us!"
35466555,700042198,2020-10-12,141626045,Sharon,"Perfect location , neat and clean 
Host was very very nice"
35512621,471606398,2019-06-17,199051118,Victor,Very nice new house in a really quite neighbourhood. Comfy bed and a kind host. Would recommend this place!
35512621,478305251,2019-06-29,204007026,Eve,"Very clean, new construction, helpful host. Lacking some personality."
36387680,559211335,2019-11-03,146910109,Alexa,"This little hideout is so, so perfect. Angela is such a thoughtful host and her attention to detail is unmatched. Besides a basket full of goodies and a bottle of wine, she also leaves little bits of milk and cream in the fridge for coffee in the morning and even little chocolates on the bed. The space is SO gorgeous and cozy and has just the perfect amount of privacy for you to relax. The interior design + shower are literally what dreams are made of."
36387680,560119070,2019-11-05,4212801,Shannon,"We enjoyed our stay at Angela’s place. It’s a cute clean and stylish space with lots of thoughtful touches like wine, little chocolates on the pillows, yummy snacks and although we brought our own there loads of toiletries!  Angela was super responsive via text message and went above and beyond to make us comfortable at the rental. Thanks again Angela! "
36387680,564814486,2019-11-16,102337666,Kathy,"From the minute I walked in I couldn’t stop finding little goodies and amenities.  It was so comfortable and modern.  Every single thing has been thought of, from chocolate on my pillow, welcoming wine and cheese and crackers, and a whole basket of necessities in case you forgot anything.  From light switches being labeled, to a great shower and pictures of stories of the local  “angry owl”, it was perfection.  The pop of yellow and big windows that look out on gorgeous scenery. (They even hung blackout curtains if you need it) you will find it inviting, comfortable and may not want to leave."
36387680,566813630,2019-11-20,308254335,Kirsten,"Angry owl hideout is absolutely perfect ! Not only is it beautifully decorated , extremely comfortable and cozy , but immaculate and close to everything ! Anytime we visit Salem , now that  we have been spoiled , we only want to come back to Angela's place !"
36387680,572041510,2019-12-01,211583288,Annmarie,"Exceeded expectations in every way - lovely space, great hosts - can’t wait until next time! "
36387680,575343867,2019-12-09,161187374,Newly,Wonderful accommodations and very responsive host. Highly recommend staying here and hope to be back soon!
36387680,582228444,2019-12-26,19706442,Paige,"We just stayed here for two nights, but I wish we could have stayed longer! The space was beautiful and clean with great interior design details. There were so many welcoming touches waiting for us, too: homemade cookies, refreshments, all the amenities and toiletries we might possibly need. Angela was communicative and helpful. Check in was easy. We lived in Salem for a few years and were just visiting family, so we didn’t take advantage of all the great local tips Angela curated in a little welcome book."
36387680,594082603,2020-01-17,76001837,Lea,"The Angry Owl Hideout is a gem. Thoughtfully decorated and with every extra amenity you can think of, it is perfect for a get-away vacation or a home base for an out-of-town work week. I loved it and will definitely stay again❤️"
36387680,601881386,2020-02-04,310299701,Karen,Excellent
36387680,604281726,2020-02-10,324144181,Christopher,"The Angry Owl Hideout was the perfect getaway for me. The place is very clean and packed with amenities. The vibe is simple, yet cozy. Large windows in the bedroom offer a great view, and have blackout curtains for sleeping and privacy. The bathroom has a wonderful 'rain' shower head that was very relaxing. The living area is super cozy-- I enjoyed kicking back in front of the fireplace style heater and watching TV while sipping on some local mead from the grocery. There is a full kitchen with wonderful butcher block counter tops. Everything inside is very aesthetically pleasing. Clean whites, vibrant yellow for a nice contrast on sleek black. Whoever did the interior design certainly did a terrific job. You can tell the host takes extra care to make sure you won't need anything (and we didn't). Everywhere you look, there are necessities in case you happened to leave something behind (soaps, toothbrushes, etc).

As for the location, the Angry Owl Hideout is minutes away from downtown Salem, and about an hour away from Portland. My itinerary was pretty packed on this stay, so I didn't get a chance to check out as many local things as I would have liked, but there are tons of great options...we tried a couple restaurants that the host recommended in informational literature left on the counter, and they were fantastic!

The self check-in was a great feature for me, as my 6 hour flight didn't land until very late in the evening, and after that haul, I was in no condition to be face to face with other humans. The host will text you your personal door code before your check-in, which will allow you to come and go as you please, without having to worry about keeping up with any keys/cards.

All in all, I would absolutely stay here again, should I be back in Salem. And I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone if it meets your requirements. I can't say enough nice things about this place."
36387680,608116152,2020-02-19,28369674,Ramond,Amazing spot with great views and amenities. Perfect for long or short stays.
36387680,611003218,2020-02-25,76001837,Lea,It’s a great place to stay for a few nights or a longer visit. Will definitely come again :)
36387680,612518183,2020-02-29,106260924,Shannon,"The space was amazing, very accommodating, best neighborhood, comfy bed, and great view! Definitely staying here everytime we go to salem."
36387680,622824458,2020-04-20,344105618,Collin,"Good location, very clean, apartment with tons of finishes and nice touches."
36387680,624691830,2020-05-13,338775516,Steph,This place is so cute!!! It’s perfect and I felt at home.  All the sweet touches and being able to sit outside and look at the view.  Everything I needed was there and I would definitely come back.  ❤️
36387680,629983875,2020-06-15,347919245,Rhett,"The apartment is equipped with everything you need and then some special touches.  Clean, well set up, cozy with a fabulous view.  TV and internet flawless. The administrator and the owners are very friendly and helpful.  All together a great place to stay."
36387680,632095192,2020-06-25,344937456,Elizabeth,Such a beautiful place!!
36387680,635560811,2020-07-06,85463604,Teri,"What a darling hide away. It's a perfect use of space, small but doesn't feel it. Beautiful yard and views.  Very clean, very thoughtful in design and amenities.  The ENTIRE Sue Grafton Alphabet series is there, which is perfect as the protagonist lives in a small, ideal space.

My only suggestion would be to add the Hit Man series by Lawrence (Website hidden by Airbnb) the Hit Man always envisions himself living in every town he goes to.  Easy to do at the Angry Owl.  

Thank you, Angela, was a great home base while in Salem!"
36387680,643079631,2020-07-26,183883000,Christopher,Angela's place is simply amazing.
36387680,646754669,2020-08-04,166294201,Anna,"I wish I lived at Angela's place. It was the perfect size to relax during a long work trip. It was quiet, had all of the amenities I could've needed (the washer/dryer was a life saver) and it's gorgeous to boot. Angela herself was a pleasure to talk to and made adjustments for me when she didn't have to. I'd definitely stay here again."
36387680,671279968,2020-10-04,362004801,Christoper,Angela’s place is wonderful. Nice little touches that make the place so comfortable.
36387680,700048683,2020-10-12,95440094,Brittany,Very nice and comfortable spot. I stayed for a week while working in Salem and it was especially nice to have a full kitchen and washer/dryer for a longer stay like that.
36387680,701876784,2020-10-18,266882390,Jake,"Cute little place, perfect for my wife and I for a quick trip to see some family in Salem."
36771163,496668371,2019-07-27,17636023,Erika,"Newly renovated apartment with minimalist modern decor. Comes with a full size kitchen and washer & dryer (such a bonus!), but nothing extra is provided,  like cooking oil or laundry detergent. There is a grocery store across the street if you need, though."
36771163,497637097,2019-07-28,273982909,Julie,Everything was great! They even helped when my car broke down
36771163,507635380,2019-08-11,163162294,Kevin,Great space and super accommodating host!
36771163,516688288,2019-08-24,167293160,Timothy,.
36771163,517687203,2019-08-25,1497891,Joe,Troy's apartment was stylish and clean. It's one of your best bets if you're visiting Salem. Our check-in code was incorrect but fortunately Liz was quick to reply with a working code.
36771163,528246118,2019-09-12,143056119,Katie,"Enjoyed my stay in this apartment overall. Was a guest for 3 weeks. The bed was comfy and the aesthetics of the apartment were very attractive and modern. Communication with the co-host was very responsive and quick. My only major qualm with the apartment was the constant fan in the laundry closet. When it would stop and start, would sometimes wake me up. Probably wouldn’t have minded as much if I would have had a shorter stay. Would stay here again!"
36771163,537436221,2019-09-28,232625234,Jodie,"The unit is in a great location, walk to the Capitol building and park, as well as other parks, Saturday Market, and shopping. It's pet friendly, which is great if you have fur family., no carpet (which I love) just throw rugs."
36771163,559839067,2019-11-04,53506242,Agustus,"IKEA styled apartment with the necessary items. VERY CLEAN. Kitchen is brand new and there is a large walk in closet.

FYI- the unit does have a bit of a loud fan and you’ll need to provide your own Netflix account.

Thanks for a great stay!!"
36771163,566836489,2019-11-20,198333200,Angel,"Very clean, nice and cozy stay."
36771163,571141204,2019-11-30,1770084,Karen,My family spent a wonderful Thanksgiving weekend at Troy's place!
36771163,573258520,2019-12-05,81961568,Pamela,The apartment looks exactly likes the pictures. The building is being converted from offices to apartments so the insulation isn't the greatest.  The owner brought over space heaters immediately which really helped.  Slippers are provided since the floors are the trendy cement which are cold in the winter.  The TV requires some time of special subscriptions to watch anything other than reruns from the 1970s.. That was a big disappointment and a mistake i hope i don't make again.  I like to be able to just turn on the TV and go.
36771163,583454481,2019-12-28,7805901,Eric,"This is the second time I have stayed in this building, the first time was in a different apartment.  It is clean, safe, spacious, and comfortable.  There are good dishes and other kitchen ware, and its location is perfect for us to visit with our daughter who works in the court house.  Also we appreciate being across the street from a Safeway and a short walk from good coffee, restaurants, etc.  We were able to cook a few nice meals there, and it was nice to have a good oven and dishwasher.  There is some reference in earlier reviews to a noisy fan, and in fact the fan for the heating and cooling is somewhat loud, but there was thoughfully a space heater so we could just use that at night.  Though I am a noise-sensitive traveller, this was not a problem for us at all.  When we visit in the future, we will try to stay here again.  Thanks!"
36771163,587927400,2020-01-03,82267347,Melissa,"This space is ideal for being close to pretty much everything near downtown, the capitol bldg, and Willamette University. It’s a short walk from Amtrak. We didn’t need a car. We got lucky with only a little bit of rain. The space was stylish, clean and worked perfectly as a home base for our layover in Salem. We spent time strolling the area and took in some wonderful Oregon history.  We also appreciated having a Safeway supermarket nearby to stock up on a few tidbits and goodies to do a bit of cooking on New Year’s Day evening when restaurants were closing early."
36771163,621158749,2020-03-28,82315020,Marie,"Nice place to visit, walkable to town. Expect to meet very colorful people."

The house was decorated beautifully and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I loved the outside area with lights for us to hang out and enjoy each other's company. Very beautiful home. Kathie went above and beyond on making sure we had everything needed for our stay.
36806045,502585376,2019-08-04,139330869,Matthew,"Kathie's place was clean, comfortable, and had all the touches to make us feel right at home. I would 100% recommend a stay here."

The location was convenient for visiting downtown and had quick access I-5.  Kathie responded quickly to all my questions and the kitchen was well equipped for family meals together. Hope we can visit again soon.
36806045,556876445,2019-10-30,4972393,AllanLinda,Everything about our stay at Kathie’s was good.

36806045,575352192,2019-12-09,224175432,Mylinh,"Very clean and comfortable.   There were beautiful wood floors, a warm fireplace, and lots of space.  The shower felt great and the bed linens were very nice.   The Christmas tree, simply lit with white lights, was such a charming seasonal touch.  The check in was very easy.  The road that the property is located on is quite busy with traffic.  We stayed in the back room and it quieted down significantly at night and we slept with no disturbance.  This was a great choice for our stay and I would have enjoyed to have been there another night."
36806045,580573613,2019-12-22,2231931,Chris,This cozy house is nicely styled with comfortable beds and a nice kitchen with washer/dryer.  There were even some toys for our grandkids who came to stay with us a couple of nights.  The street outside was busy but quieted down at night.  The location was great for us.
36806045,582830778,2019-12-27,13274352,Lauren,"We were so impressed with the beautiful renovation of this Salem home. Kathie took care to modernize and put in high-end appliances. The house was spotless, and the beds were very comfortable. Kathie was responsive to all of our needs, and her dog Hilo was super cute and friendly. We had a wonderful stay. The house is on Market Street which is a busy thoroughfare, so if you are sensitive to sound, you might want to bring ear plugs. Getting in and out of the driveway wasn't as bad as we thought it would be."
36806045,586419794,2020-01-01,313478005,Tim,Kathie's place is a charming home in the heart of Salem.  It's clean and bright with a delightful ocean theme.  You will thoroughly enjoy your stay!

The Bed was Huge & the most comfortable bed we have slept in anywhere on the road! We love to walk and my wife had the best 4 mile daily walk with beautiful lil houses & landscaping!! We were in Salem to visit our Granddaughter who is a Softball player & Pre- Med Student.  We were 5 minutes to Willamette U & Downtown Salem. Close to the 5 and many restaurants! Kathy was so accommodating for everything we needed! She is a Wonderful Lady & made our Stay amazing!! We will be back Next year!! So informative explaining all the Sights to visit!! Thank you Kathie!

36806045,620119212,2020-03-20,134006225,Carolann,"We were so grateful for Kathie’s space! We had a sudden change of plans and ended up needing a place to stay last minute. Kathie responded to us immediately and even told us we could check in at any time we needed!
Her home was clean, accommodating, and relaxing. We enjoyed time on the private patio, had a full kitchen to make dinner, and relaxed for the evening.
Kathie, thank you so much for sharing your space with us!"
36806045,620565893,2020-03-22,342103616,Noel,Very amazing Place and will definitely be booking later on.
37157862,497787639,2019-07-28,70833648,Jean,Perfect place to be. Relaxing sound of the water and wonderfully clean and neat. We had a wifi hotspot on our telephone and we set up the TV. You will love this place. There was plenty of room for our family of five. Three adults and 2 children. We all love the stream running directly behind the condo.
37157862,498485089,2019-07-29,64844342,Hayley,Amanda was really accommodating for a last minute booking — the apartment was really nice and spacious with convenient parking outside. And the creek view from the balcony is so cool!
37157862,499032445,2019-07-30,13965270,Jim,Great value and comfort! Amanda did a super job communicating and all went well. Would definitely rent again.
37157862,500196853,2019-08-01,155291971,Dick And Suzanne,Great value‼️My  favorite place at apartment was the balcony over looking the stream with all the lush foliage and trees
37157862,502584131,2019-08-04,53968031,David,"Nice space, with a great deck overlooking the creek.
Very convenient to downtown"
37157862,505782791,2019-08-09,60276082,Christine,"The sound of the running creek is a peaceful from the deck of this condo. The host was very friendly and responded quickly to my emails. She made sure I had ample parking close by. The condo was neat ,  tidy and had everything I needed for a short stay. Beds were very comfy and the  linens were high quality. Downtown Salem is within walking distance."
37157862,507644723,2019-08-11,3629152,Wilma,Sparkling clean
37157862,510159727,2019-08-15,222089778,Candace,"I loved everything about this place, would recommend!"
37157862,517786162,2019-08-25,128866577,Kathryn,"Just a block from downtown, great location to wander and close enough to Salem’s farmers market too! Dog friendly! Foggy loved it. The place itself was super clean and nice. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided which is always helpful. AC unit in the bedroom. Creek off the patio, it was nice opening the slider door and listening to it. Since this is close to downtown, once it gets dark there are homeless people but they stuck to themselves and didn’t bother us while we walked our dog. I’d definitely stay again! :)"
37157862,518982352,2019-08-27,121478663,Honey Jean,"It’s a great spot, a great place :-) rather large apartment with a beautiful creek running behind it. Could one ask for more!?"
37157862,520029634,2019-08-29,283448250,Pamela,"Accommodations were comfortable, clean, and close to amenities.  Loved the creek!  We had breakfast each morning out on the balcony.  I had forgotten to pack a couple items and was pleasantly surprised that the condo had them.  Every question asked was promptly answered.  This was our first Airbnb experience and for future travel I will look first to them for accommodations."
37157862,522992724,2019-09-02,139224766,Randy,"This place was incredibly clean and so close to stores and bars! The three other people in my group particularly enjoyed The Coin Jam, a bar with arcade games in the back that was minutes from the property.

Parking is great, there is ample space for food and belongings and the bathroom was spacious for even the four of us to get ready. 

The host was great in the little time we needed her as the vast majority of the time it went flawlessly. The one small issue we had was resolved with open communication and great respect. She really has earned her superhost rating!

We greatly recommend this property for the type of group we had (two couples) and of course would stay again if given the opportunity! Our only regret is not staying longer!"
37157862,524835956,2019-09-06,190205699,Logan,Such a beautiful cozy place. Felt like home from the second you walk in. Very clean and has everything you will need while your there. The hosts are very nice and they are very good about being available to answer any questions or concerns you might have. Loved it and would defiantly stay again. Best Airbnb I’ve ever been in
37157862,526987888,2019-09-09,29060277,Kyle,"Nice two bedroom right on the creek.
The area is kind of loud with interesting conversations and hang outs on the bridge next to the place.
Shades in the bedrooms don't block light very well and the windows do allow a good amount of outside noise in.
Large parking spot almost right outside the door.
Roomy place."
37157862,528253720,2019-09-12,253530699,Jennie,"Nice place to stay. I love the brook right off the deck. The carpet must have been recently washed though, the house had a musty smell."
37157862,528808015,2019-09-13,25376812,Debra,"This place was absolutely delightful! Loved the babbling creek outside, the spaciousness of the space, how clean it was!! And for me, a Willamette parent who had to make a last minute/emergency trip up to Salem, it was PERFECT! I needed more nights which they sadly, did not have - (next place wasn’t nearly as perfect)!! I am already planning my next stay there."
37157862,530435438,2019-09-15,51276711,Trish,We absolutely loved the sound of the river!! The location made it possible to walk to anywhere downtown. The place was very clean!
37157862,531012896,2019-09-16,178721839,Meg,This was a cute place for a nights stay in Salem as we were passing by.
37157862,535980559,2019-09-25,289925070,David,It’s a easy to find Airbnb with everything you need for a short stay. Perfect situated in Salem.
37157862,540544062,2019-10-03,27621462,Lauren,"First off, this place was super clean, which I appreciate more than anything. Unfortunately, the space was sparsely furnished with no nightstands in one bedroom and no end tables or coffee table to set drinks on in the living room. I spent quite a bit of time in the home during our stay, and it was not conducive to actually living in the space. I had to pull a chair over to set a drink on by the couch, and I had nowhere to set my phone or a water while I slept besides the floor. There are no curtains in the bedrooms, so the light from outside came in through the blinds, which made it hard to sleep, even if I could have slept with all the yelling and screaming outside throughout the night. I don’t know where it was coming from, but I had to keep white noise playing to even get a little sleep. I was in town for a conference and ended up so exhausted during the day from lack of sleep to be able to focus. I really wish I could have left a better review because it was so clean and the location was close to downtown, but three days later I’m still exhausted and annoyed at the experience I had. Only stay here if you plan to drink or medicate yourself sleep."
37157862,541747495,2019-10-05,162016354,Jillian,This cute condo is in a location close to downtown Salem. There was lots of space and the ambient noise from the Mill Creek was relaxing. Amanda was always quick to respond and answer our questions during booking. Thanks!
37157862,544644009,2019-10-10,162570367,Liz,"Great location and wonderful space! Enjoyed our stay at the condo and loved the sound of the creek next to it! Highly recommend and would absolutely return, very clean as well, it was perfect!"
37157862,546670667,2019-10-13,40234737,Sherry,"Amanda’s place was perfect for us. We were two Mom’s visiting our college sons. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pans & dishes allowing us to make a home cooked meal for the boys. The location next to the stream was peaceful & beautiful. I’ll be staying at Amanda’s place again!"
37157862,554631268,2019-10-26,127884366,Steve,We stayed one night and it fit the bill.  Thanks!
37157862,556529214,2019-10-29,232327,Brandi,"Stayed in Salem for several days at Amanda's place! I was very pleased with host communication and hospitality, easy check in and the place had lots of extra perks that were great! Lots of extra blankets, and towels and the beds were very comfortable. The running creek behind the unit was relaxing and peaceful. Travel to Salem often and will be more than glad to return.
Amanda was easy and fast with communication and very helpful with all my requests!
Great Job to an Excellent Host"
37157862,557751266,2019-11-01,305757585,David,Great place to stay if you are in the Salem area. Very accommodating and great hospitality and not to mention super clean. The sound of the creek was amazing. 10/10 would recommend.
37157862,559196570,2019-11-03,167945671,Jennifer,"Cute condo alongside a creek which adds to the character and charm of the place. Super clean, neighborhood was fine, and close to downtown. Working with Amanda was so easy, she accurately described everything we needed to know. Highly recommend staying at this location."
37157862,560728140,2019-11-07,303777801,Capella,"What a fantastic place,  my daughter wants to live there forever.  The view is gorgeous with fall colored broad leaf maples over the creek. I enjoyed listening to the burble of the creek as I slept. The kitchen has all the tools I needed for cooking meals. It was perfect."
37157862,561563094,2019-11-09,13650996,Alan,Just as shown and clean.  Nice to be able to hear the creek running at night.  We enjoyed our night there.

37157862,572026836,2019-12-01,14211849,Jim,Great stay!  Very clean place!  We enjoyed hearing the sound of the river flowing while we slept.  The coffee was delicious and the beds were comfortable.
37157862,572703715,2019-12-03,288659630,Lanelle,"Beautiful home, easy check in, and great host that go above and beyond"
37157862,574766656,2019-12-08,5165657,Nicole,"This is a lovely space, very close to campus and everything central to Salem. It’s very nice to hear the creek outside the bedroom window. It’s a cozy, clean and warm space. It was perfect for my visit with my son, who attends Willamette.   I really enjoyed my time there. The parking space right next to apartment was also so convenient. Communication was excellent with hosts. I would stay here again."
37157862,578753555,2019-12-18,68902419,Margie/Richard,"Amanda & her team are amazing! This is the second place of Amanda’s that I’ve stayed & she does not disappoint. It was very comfortable, cozy yet spacious & perfect location for us. It was close to work, our favorite yoga studio & downtown. There is also a laundry facility on site - very convenient. We will definitely be back!"
37157862,579878298,2019-12-21,134807639,Brenda,Place is very clean and convenient if you need to be downtown Salem area.
37157862,580521429,2019-12-22,258112699,Benjamin,Great communication and super friendly to talk to. Offered to return a beloved Pooh bear that got left behind. Very thoughtful. Great place. Super clean and comfy beds. Super convenient for our short stay. Thx so much!!

37157862,594093579,2020-01-17,315289164,Kathy,"This Airbnb was spacious and clean and in a great location (quiet residential area but close to downtown). The ""creek view"" is more of a rushing river that was really close to the condo.  I loved the sound of the water at night. Enjoy!"
37157862,595225372,2020-01-19,117798861,Mireya,"Great location, very spacious condo. The stream is just outside the large deck ."
37157862,595712974,2020-01-20,52317293,Jillian,"Super cute and very clean! The creek is beautiful and I enjoyed falling asleep to the sound. 

Accessibility to our vehicle and to surrounding businesses was a breeze. 
Would definitely stay here again."
37157862,596158925,2020-01-21,326560963,Markus,"Great place, quiet and private. The creek outside created wonderful ambiance."
37157862,596748141,2020-01-23,28345669,Chris,Amanda's condo was very homey. We had close access to all of Salem and we loved all the extra towels and bedding. Amanda was very responsive throughout the stay.
37157862,597509343,2020-01-25,296422508,Jasmin,Had a great stay everything looked very modern and up to date it was a lovely condo and I’ll stay again in the future ☺️
37157862,598301364,2020-01-26,174456224,Carl,This place is fantastic! Thank you.
37157862,600442978,2020-02-01,60598930,Jennifer,Excellent location and apartment. The creek is right off the patio. Within walking distance to tons of restaurants and shopping.
37157862,602119802,2020-02-05,63521186,Gloria,"Very nice, cozy and clean space to get a nice weekend off from the bug city! We loved it!"
37157862,602434356,2020-02-06,11295763,Bethany,"Great location near the Capitol, walking distance to Downtown amenities."
37157862,603933162,2020-02-09,40234737,Sherry,Amanda’s place is always clean & comfortable. Great location near downtown Salem.
37157862,607431146,2020-02-17,279940099,Ben,"Amanda's condo was spotless and had room for 5-6 people (if you use the living room sleeper sofa).  We could hear the creek in the master bedroom.  Lots of space in the living room, kitchen was well stocked and efficient to use; we used it for breakfast and dinner.   Our kids loved the supply of board and card games, plus snuggling in front of the TV.  WiFi worked perfectly.  The condo is close to the capitol and the river front park - just a few minutes drive to either; probably could have walked to the river.  I can see why it's a popular location to book."
37157862,608142971,2020-02-19,122998374,Timothy,"Amazing location and very spacious and comfortable. The balcony overlooks a flowing stream, and is so relaxing. Walking distance to downtown Salem."
37157862,608477784,2020-02-20,22266352,Meredith,"The view of the river was gorgeous.  The apartment is perfect for a short trip where you want to be comfortable and have easy access to downtown Salem, but maybe don't want to do your own cooking (limited kitchen amenities).  Overall we had a nice, quiet stay and Amanda was a pleasure to work with."
37157862,609295504,2020-02-22,88149863,Stacy,"Amanda’s apartment is great! All you need, coffee, sugar, Splenda, toiletries. The best part is that you can hear the Creek from the  bedroom and living room. Also, it’s in walking distance of downtown in a sweet neighborhood.  Highly recommend."
37157862,611709352,2020-02-27,35193957,Linda,"Amanda's place was warm, convenient for downtown (not a pleasant walk into town though) and the beds were comfortable. It is quite dated though with a heavily stained living room carpet, shower doors that don't slide easily and quite dark. We did enjoy the sound from the creek running in front of the condo but not of the upstairs resident opening and closing his sliding doors every evening! The living room is sparsely furnished and there was only one bedside table in our room, would be helpful to have on one each side. Brenda was friendly in communication and was very responsive when we thought someone was in our parking space (they weren't). 
We wouldn't stay here again, would opt for somewhere brighter and more modern. 
It is good value though and the hosts seem like nice people."
37157862,618869816,2020-03-15,336755791,Alex,Great place in my opinion
37157862,627083393,2020-05-31,116530036,Audrey,"Very comfortable and relaxing! The creek outside is super nice and refreshing, and the place was perfect! Great location, too. We really enjoyed our stay here."
37157862,631292799,2020-06-21,111437356,Kaira,"Awesome decor, incredibly accomodating, perfect location, and the creek running through the back yard area is absolutely breathtaking. I will definitely be coming back."
37157862,631557474,2020-06-22,5079733,Eula & Marvin,"This place is a a dream, the rooms are large, the beds are cozy and the bathroom is spotless. I couldn’t have asked for anything more "
37157862,632361932,2020-06-26,13647228,Robert,Lovely space close to the Capitol. It is NE Salem so it is not the nicest area of the city but the Creek right next to the place is amazing and makes up for that.
37157862,633166031,2020-06-28,229155275,Martin,Place was in a great location for the capital of Oregon. Definitely recommend for a small family or couple.
37157862,633679876,2020-06-30,209766773,Vickie,"We enjoyed our stay here it met our needs and had a great location we also loved that we were able to park right next to our condo when I travel alone sometimes it’s hard to get my luggage upstairs in through elevators but this was simple and easy.
But first and foremost I felt SAFE it’s been hard for me to find an affordable place in Salem that I wasn’t concerned for my safety.
This place is a great value"
37157862,635206935,2020-07-05,171519153,Matt,Very Spacious!  The creek out back was very relaxing to listen to as we were sitting on the deck!
37157862,636582707,2020-07-10,58121348,Robin,Beautiful  look for the doors with keyless entry  and you will be fine

37157862,641898309,2020-07-24,296349110,Bonnie,"We loved staying in this space! The glass doors and everything else were very clean, there were plenty of extra linens and towels. We stayed nice and cool with the ac/fan setup. The balcony and creek were great as well, we enjoyed game night with the family on the deck. Overall it was a great escape!"
37157862,643082280,2020-07-26,203842629,Bryan,Great value in downtown Salem.
37157862,643713269,2020-07-28,163736219,Zac,Great location. Nice amenities.
37157862,646394763,2020-08-03,79553059,Shirley,"A very relaxing home with deck overlooking a creek, excellent beds and well-appointed kitchen and bathroom."
37157862,649172177,2020-08-09,356607797,Carrie,Very clean just as described. Walked to breakfast in morning. Would stay here again.
37157862,649592951,2020-08-10,89407182,Jennifer,Nicely redone in side and has linen and towels.  Does have a terrible smoke smell at the entry/kitchen possibly from the noisy tenants above. The bathroom and the kitchen have not been redone. Kind of a dark apartment.  Probably would not recommend for people that have children. Did not feel very secure and there was a homeless camp of 5-7 people just down the street a block away if that.  The creek sound was pleasant though from the apartment.
37157862,650252721,2020-08-12,102931235,Ashley,Amanda's place was very clean and the river view was quite nice and relaxing.
37157862,653961207,2020-08-20,88149863,Stacy,"We love staying at Amanda’s, winter or summer, great place with all the touches and quick walk to downtown."
37157862,654399927,2020-08-21,329162548,Paul,.
37157862,655750200,2020-08-23,17368578,Virginia,"Clean and comfortable and close to downtown. But the location isn't great, with a lot of homeless folks hanging out too nearby for my liking (across the street). And the ""Girls Girls Girls"" sign in the house window across the street -- was that just pop art, or ... ?? And there's an upstairs flat above -- the guy was walking around at 3am, opening & closing his balcony door (audibly). And there really was no grass nearby for my dogs to pee on. Not a great fit for me. Might be fine for a business traveler."
37157862,657517031,2020-08-28,358457429,Maria,"We really enjoyed our stay at Amanda’s place. So much that we were ready to move in lol. The place itself was really nice and clean. The kitchen is fully stocked with, pots, pans, plates, cups, utensils. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was spotless. But as awesome as the inside was the best part is definitely the creek running off the deck. It was so relaxing to just sit out there and listen to the water run."
37157862,657955982,2020-08-29,248516600,Donvis,Great place! We all enjoyed it. Communication was great.
37157862,673530970,2020-10-11,15944419,Cindy,A comfortable condo with comfortable beds and a relaxing deck overlooking the creek.
37157862,701217512,2020-10-17,26202727,Kamil,"Great apartment for the price! In my brief research on apartments in Salem there was nothing close to the value this apartments provides. Cozy two separate bedrooms which are very useful when traveling with another couple. Full kitchen to your disposition, coffee equipment. TV with Roku in the living room. Great view at the creek from the balcony. You can hear it in one of the bedrooms too, so it's a great white noise for sleeping. There were some people who were homeless a block away from the apartment but it's understandable as it's few blocks from the downtown. The neighborhood is not sketchy nor dangerous. Definitely recommend."
37157862,702773481,2020-10-22,301909351,Sabrina,"Very clean, very responsive, very easy to get to,  had everything we needed! I would definitely recommend this property to others!"

She was extremely quick to respond, instantaneous actually, when we had minor difficulty with the automatic front door lock. The old neighborhood around the condo complex is eclectic and walkable. If not for the wildfire smoke, we would have enjoyed the back deck overlooking Mill Creek morning and evening. 
Highly recommend Amanda's place for your stay in Salem. 
Thanks Amanda"

I didn't get to see Riley, but he was helpful over the phone and by message. Cory met me while I was entering the room, and was friendly and helpful.  The bedroom is in a converted garage, but the bed was super comfortable, plenty of comfy pillows, extra fluffy blanket, and an adorable stuffed doggie.  Just in case it would be important to you, the kitchen does not have a microwave.  But there is a Vitamix! I didn't have occasion use it, but how cool is that?"

The bathroom is also right outside the bedroom with a shower.  It was Perfect and convenient. I would definitely recommend and stay again.

38976509,584863827,2019-12-30,973145,Eric,"Ruth's bunkhouse was a perfect fit for my needs. I have family a couple of blocks away and it was getting a little too crowded and crazy after the holidays. The bunkhouse was warm and cozy with eccentric decor and positioned in a fun garden/backyard. With no plumbing and a dry toilet, it might not be for everyone but I personally liked those touches and the effort to keep it green. Would recommend for someone looking for a simple, quiet, and affordable place to rest."
38976509,598243775,2020-01-26,304138796,Amira,"Ruth's Bunkhouse is great! It's a small space, but a great value for the location and she has made it very nice and cozy inside.

39128949,632356240,2020-06-26,25376812,Debra,"Hands down THE best Airbnb experience we have EVER had. The home was more stunning than the pictures portray. The location was supreme (we had fresh cherries picked from a tree on an EMPTY lot every morning during our walk!). It could not have been more perfect! Every single thing we could possibly need was in this house. We lacked nothing!  Communication with Robert (who lives in Europe!) was always timely and we had a local contact if needed. In the age of COVID, Robert was more than understanding of our concerns and addressed them with the utmost respect & compassion. We were so sad leaving and are already trying to figure out when we can return. This vacation, which was difficult for us as we moved our son up to Salem for school & “adulting” was made less difficult by having this gorgeous home to return to each day after the hours of helping our son. We will be back!! Thank you Robert for trusting us in your ultra comfortable, showpiece of a home."
39128949,659231259,2020-08-31,4997225,Rayman,"Roberts place exceeded our expectations. The house is beautifully designed and very thoughtfully put together; the upscale kitchen had all the appliances we needed, and the view was incredible. Robert is also very responsive and was glad to have an opportunity to meet in person. Would recommend this place without any reservation."
39128949,666902115,2020-09-21,58902160,Lindsay,"Roberts home is not only stunning both inside and out but the amenities, cleanliness and thoughtfulness that went into this BnB is top notch. My family and I loved our stay and can't wait to visit again. If you are coming to Salem, stop your search now. Robert's place is one of a kind and you won't be disappointed."
39128949,671231627,2020-10-04,89775385,Michael,Such an amazing place. Robert was an amazing host and we couldn't have asked for anything more in our stay
39498664,580297298,2019-12-22,95802676,Pengyu,"这是一次非常愉快的入住体验｡位置好,出门三四百米就是梅西百货及塞勒姆中心｡房间在河边,宽敞,取暖也很给力｡性价比还算高｡房东Amanda沟通顺畅,消息回复及需求响应很及时｡我们因为行程问题几次变动入住及延住,都得到了非常及时的协助｡唯一不足就是房间朝北,没有太阳｡好在冬天阴雨天多,也算影响不大｡推荐｡
We had a very happy stay with Amanda. The location is good close to salem center in walk distance. The apartment right sits along the creek. It was clean and big enough for 6 people. Amanda is very supportive and react to our request very quick and with thoughtful solutions. I would recommend It and come back again if I visit Salem in the future."
39498664,669957033,2020-10-01,53142964,Suzanne,"I highly recommend this unit, it was clean, updated and we didn’t have any issues with the location. We will definitely rent there again."
39822792,622085844,2020-04-09,329572675,Zackery,"Tiger station lofts have it all! We showed up to a fully stocked apartment with everything we needed - even shampoo! The space is very comfortable, and in the heart of down town Salem! There are tons of restaurants and bars within a block (too bad COVID has them closed). Angela the host was very attentive and made sure we had all that we needed. All in all an amazing stay! I would 100% make this my first choice if I need another AirBnB in Salem!"
39822792,627122128,2020-05-31,346704541,Fabrizio,Made everything extremely easy.  Great location and a good place to stay.  Definitely appreciate the laundry facilities.
39822792,628811088,2020-06-10,65802604,Darren,Angela is an amazing host!  The loft was even better than described and she was incredibly responsive!!  5-stars!!!
39822792,631883816,2020-06-24,347919245,Rhett,"The apartment is spacious and tasteful, set up with all the amenities for an easy stay. Can't beat the location."
39822792,635563276,2020-07-06,286020097,Christine,"Wonderful downtown location! Loved walking in the beautiful park across the street. Angela is very quick to respond and could even accommodate us for a same day booking. We stayed a week as we were there adopting our newborn son, and we felt very safe. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and fully stocked.  There is a private parking spot out back. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
39822792,636264726,2020-07-09,346352577,Sonya,"What a delightful spot to come home to!  Every where you look there are little touches to provide just what you need - comfortable beds, furniture, light, and nice towels.  We were in Salem for the passing of our father and coming back to The Tiger Loft after long days was just what we needed."
39822792,640281204,2020-07-19,283820496,Laura,"Tiger Station is a convenient location in the center of Salem. Lots of restaurants, shops, and parks with in walking distance. The space itself is stylish with beautiful updates and lots of charm. Loved my stay in Salem!"
39822792,641503307,2020-07-23,296117680,Ben,"Tiger Station loft is perfectly located downtown next to the river park and Capitol.   It's cozy and clean 
with a nice kitchen and super comfortable beds. 
Angela is easy to work with and very kind.   "
39822792,649095065,2020-08-09,40808648,Aaron,Great location with an excellent host!!
39822792,653575833,2020-08-19,206176706,Matt,"If you’re looking for the ideal “launchpad” for your trip to Salem, look no further! Angela’s charming downtown, walk-up apartment is an easy walk to everything you could want in city center, including being one block away from the lovely riverfront park and nature preserve (20 miles of spectacular Willamette valley nature paths). 

Her communication is fantastic and the apartment itself is very well appointed, comfortable, stylish and has great historic charm. We love to cook (not just during COVID times!) when we travel to AirBNBs and Angela’s place is very well equipped with a large and comfortable kitchen. 

Our trip was specifically to drop our daughter off for her freshman year at Willamette University. If you’re in Salem to visit WU, this is a great location. Just blocks from campus as well.

Please consider renting this AirBNB...you won’t be disappointed."
39822792,655666878,2020-08-23,197562528,Karen,"We loved Angela’s Tiger Station Lofts in downtown Salem. It was very clean, clutter free, and beautifully decorated. I enjoyed the white bedding and earthy palette. We also enjoyed being near the Riverfront park and downtown. We ate at Wild Pears and Masonery Grill nearby. Both had great food! Don’t miss the ice cream place either."
39822792,660662151,2020-09-05,363974752,Aleecia,"Book this gem now! Angela is an extraordinarily thoughtful hostess, and you will find attention to detail throughout (coffee station, ample kitchen basics, fully stocked bathroom down to a makeup mirror, q-tips, and cotton balls.) Wifi keeps up with video conferences, no problem. Crucial for long stays, there's even a clothes washer/dryer in unit. 

We are on the concerned side for Covid-19. This apartment was cleaned, aired out, had fans running, everything spotless. While we would not travel for fun during a pandemic, we were refugees from California wildfire smoke. We were able to get work done and not have irreversible lung damage. :-/ We were very glad to have been in Angela's place for the week!

But what if you were going for post-pandemic fun... then you're in for a great time. There's a trail head at the end of the block with great hiking along the river and through the woods, bird watching, and a carousel! In the other direction, lots of restaurants (we didn't partake but they looked great.) The convention center is an easy walk, and it's not too far to walk to the university. About 35 minutes away, you can drive to the trailhead for the 10 waterfall hike in Silver Falls State Park, which is absolutely spectacular. The night sky is dark enough that if you time things right you can drive about half an hour to see the milky way, but this is very much based on time of year, and it was a faint dusting when we were there. 

The only downside, and this is disclosed: noise. As of summer, 2020, there's construction on the place next door. They are often shouting back and forth while they set up by 6:30 am. In addition, at literally all hours, people seem to set up music outside and blast it. No pattern we could find, and it wasn't every night. This might be related to street protests, but I was never awake enough to get up and figure it out. 

Other than the noise, which is neither the hostess' fault nor within her control, it was a spectacular stay. She is kind and a great communicator. You'll have a great time!"
39822792,662181727,2020-09-08,42786560,Carolyn,"Angela was great to work with! The Tiger Station loft is conveniently located, nicely updated, and sparkling clean!"
39822792,664016731,2020-09-13,141204749,Jennelle,Thank you!
39822792,668188203,2020-09-26,196936577,Larry,Great place in a great location!  Literally within a block of many great restaurants.  Lots of places within walking distance from the State capital to a really nice park.

39969910,620135202,2020-03-20,162558545,Lynsie,"I would 100% recommend staying here, I am so sad to be leaving. I was here for 6 weeks and I had everything I needed! It has tons of great amenities, like a fireplace, a garage, washer dryer, dishwasher, full kitchen, two TVs with Xfinity, and a super comfy king sized bed. The location was great. Judy was a great host and was always quick getting back to me and is just a friendly person. I really hope I can stay here again!"
39969910,622222711,2020-04-11,40896898,David,"Our stay at Judy’s place was very comfortable and nice, (despite new rules around Coronavirus).  The home is/was well equipped, with everything we needed for our extended stay.  Having a kitchen set up that someone has taken care to include everything, as well as a washer and dryer in the unit, exceptional.  
We enjoyed our stay, being able to walk to Bush Park and Roadhouse.  The neighborhood felt very safe and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this duplex to others.
(A new barbecue was delivered, while we were there, but we didn’t get a chance to use it).  The hosts responded to questions/inquiries quickly and were very  helpful and accommodating.
Great choice for us.  Thank you."
39969910,625345380,2020-05-19,92727880,Brenda,"Judy’s place was really comfortable and location to downtown, Bush Park, and Minto Brown rec area was ideal. Lots of nice touches and Judy was very responsive and easy to communicate with! 
Would definitely stay here again!"

39969910,656462248,2020-08-25,64086027,Kerry,"Great place to relax and enjoy Salem. Judy’s place is quiet, clean, and beautifully updated. Added extras include a garage, back patio. and washing machine/dryer. With all of this and close proximity to downtown, Bush Pasture Park, and Minto Brown Island Park, you can’t go wrong"
39969910,661771961,2020-09-07,138226610,Rashaun,This place was a cute little place with such a homey vibe.
39969910,664685842,2020-09-15,366794830,Mary,Beautiful space with lovely owners. Dog friendly which was a major plus. Would absolutely recommend staying here when you visit the Salem area.
39969910,668911982,2020-09-27,192494080,Austin,"Judy's space was exactly as described. Perfectly located with stylish accents, comfy and warm. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is traveling in the area."

40070743,579867690,2019-12-21,270042453,Valentino,Very clean and well taken care of place. Other tenants that live in the home are easy going and quiet that you hardly notice them.
40070743,581758943,2019-12-25,63615762,Jennifer,"We loved this house! I don’t even want to say how much we enjoyed it because it’s going to be all rented up when we want to stay again!

The kitchen is greatly equipped! Thoughtful touches in the bathroom and kitchen area. We loved the chalkboard wall and thankful wall.

My son loved the small space with tv and play station. My daughter claimed the hammock chair and enjoyed a book in it. I can’t wait to enjoy the deck during a summer stay.

It was very clean and the owners are super quick to respond!"
40070743,595154495,2020-01-19,28345669,Chris,"Tim and Lisa's home was lovely and spacious. We especially loved ""Tim's Cave"". The home was very quiet and there were no issues with the other tenants on the property."
40070743,598146794,2020-01-26,152647651,Laine,Sparkling clean!  Comfortable beds with all the amenities!  The kids loved the chalk board wall and loft!  We would stay again.
40070743,603863458,2020-02-09,149456730,Lupe,"Great place for the value! Had three very comfy beds and lots of room. Easy access too. Parking is limited to two spaces due to other living on the property (you won’t run into them), but we parked nearby. Thanks to Tim and Lisa!"

40309240,581011081,2019-12-23,137465098,Brenda,Paula was the best host ever. Super clean and beautiful accommodations in a beautiful neighborhood. She was a great communicator and all the beds were really comfortable. Best ever!
40309240,640223902,2020-07-19,112484448,Andrea,"This place was very clean and comfortable. Lots of bed pillow varieties,  soft/firm. Bed was clean and comfortable. Lots of extra room on main level to spread out. Kitchen was stocked with all kinds of utensils. The backyard was fenced and very large. Quiet and lovely, with birds and flowers.  A very quiet neighborhood.  Felt very safe. Hostess was very quick with responses. She had the place very clean and sanitized!! Parking in front and very easy check in."
40841525,629111765,2020-06-12,337341564,Emily,"Expect to overall not get your money’s worth whatsoever.
- Not known who has a key besides the host (brother showed up twice during first week without notice) 
- EXTREMELY bad cell and wifi service in basement despite booster installed - if you work at home, you MUST be aware of the extremely bad service, both cell & internet. Many times my calls were dropped with clients while working. Eventually host gave an ethernet cable but service is still abysmal down here. 
- “Fully furnished” should be taken lightly - only 2 towels, 2 pillows, 10 hangers, 1 pot - you get the idea. Expect to bring your own cookware, dishes, trash can, toilet paper, toaster, etc. Yes it’s a long term stay but if you are looking for a fully furnished airbnb then this is not it.
- Host has 2 constantly active cameras at the entrance of the apartment that he watches “every night” per his statement; the presence of which & the active recording of which was not disclosed until after a month and a half of residency.
- Host attempted to charge $5/night if I had a guest over even though we were adhering to his outlined guest policies and house rules re: guests. 
- No kitchen appliances for almost a week and a half upon move-in - when I requested a discussion about appropriate compensation, host told me I could give him same-day notice and “move out tomorrow for a refund”. Use of upstairs kitchen was allowed during this time however. 
- Continually requested privacy curtain to be added to sliding glass door (main entrance and view into the basement) which never happened. 
- When homeowner is home, he spends majority of his time in the garage which shares a wall with the bedroom down here. He regularly has band practice which consists of very loud music carrying into the bedroom to the point that you cannot have a phone call or listen to something even with headphones. It lasts for hours and hours and goes as late as 10:30pm. 
- The listing states you have access to a backyard, however the lawn hadn’t been mowed for years. Finally got mowed, but is covered in dog poop that never gets picked up.
- $500 cleaning/service fee but never any services, cleaning, or check ins completed. I had to clean the place upon moving in. No cleaning supplies of a kitchen garbage can are even supplied. 
- Stapling on carpet coming out for weeks - stepped on them daily & made my hand bleed. Told host & it never got fixed. 
- No garbage service - host takes trash to the dump once a month so it piles up in the driveway & reeks."
40861468,598261093,2020-01-26,68259491,Erin,"Great place! MUCH bigger than we expected! We didn’t see it during daylight, but it looks like it has a great yard and big windows that would let in lots of light. Has everything you need - the one quirk (which she says in the listing) is the bathroom sink is the only sink. Not a problem for us - easy to do the few dishes we used. Better than a hotel for less!"
40861468,606838176,2020-02-16,73862168,Jeff,"Cassi has a great place, it's much more spacious than it appears in the pictures. There is a large backyard that our dog thoroughly enjoyed running around in, and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make a small meal. Cassi was great about responding quickly, and accommodated our group of 4. There's a huge river park nearby that we ran down to that was really nice."
41338909,601542374,2020-02-03,98411204,Brent,"Really enjoyed our stay! The bedroom, kitchen and bathroom were sparkling clean!  Had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay, would highly recommend it and definitely would stay here again!"

41338909,611666789,2020-02-27,326892275,Katherine,"I can't say enough about how great Heather and Nick are as hosts-- the communication was excellent and their place was incredibly comfortable and cozy. There were lots of thoughtful amenities (great coffee, filtered water, extra blankets and pillows, as well as a rack for hanging clothes) and they were so friendly and helpful as I got settled in my new location. If you're visiting Salem, or have friends or family coming to stay, I highly recommend Englewood Loft-- it's quiet, in a great location and hosted by wonderful people!"
41338909,614960778,2020-03-06,331453062,Sheila,"Comfortable, cozy, and clean! Communication was excellent and Heather & Nick are amazing hosts. I felt so at home and will definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Salem!"
41338909,622378440,2020-04-13,107062101,Amber,Super clean and all the things you need for a little home away from home. I really appreciated the washer and dryer as I had to unexpectedly extend my stay! Heather also answered all of my messages within minutes.
41338909,623030255,2020-04-24,187801372,Dolores,"I love this place! Comfortable space tucked up in among beautiful leafy trees, great kitchen, awesome cold water jugs in the fridge, and very convenient for Salem government travel. Wonderful hosts. I loved that they had a few books out to read, because with all the libraries & book shops being closed right now, I really miss books. That said, a tiny night light near the bed would make it even more awesome! :)"
41338909,623311164,2020-04-28,147736206,Tana,Such a cute space and larger than we thought! Very clean and adorable. Would love to stay again!
41338909,624170315,2020-05-07,166462794,Marlaine,"Very nice, private place.  Heather is a delight to work with and it was very clean.  Just what we needed for a quiet getaway."

They are also extremely friendly and gave us some great advice about our upcoming move to Salem. All-in-all, we really enjoyed our time at Heather and Nick's, and would absolutely stay again."
41338909,629318053,2020-06-13,18208671,Christian,"Expect a clean and comfortable space, great hospitality, easy check-in/out, and consistent communication from friendly hosts!"
41338909,634314079,2020-07-03,348139512,Charles,"This is a really neat space and everything it claims to be. Heather was a really great host and was very quick to respond to any request. The place was exceptionally clean and they do a great job of making it a very welcoming space. It was extremely comfortable and little things like an awesome shower made for a very relaxing stay. The chickens are awesome. They won't bother you at all and it's neat to have them. One morning they were sitting at the bottom of the steps just waiting to say hello. But they will simply walk away and leave you alone. Definitely don't shy away if that is of any concern. It's a really nice, clean space and the hosts are great people as well."
41338909,635776488,2020-07-07,38705845,Devon,"I had a terrific stay at Heather's place. Everything I could think of was accommodated for, and it's a very fun and relaxing space to boot. Location is in a great neighborhood too. Definitely will check for availability with Heather the next time I'm in Salem."

Super convenient location, instant communication with Heather, easy contactless entry. The space was so comfy and welcoming, even had a washer and dryer. Bonus points for the nice, quiet neighborhood, the resident hens and the Keurig, with its tower of cups. Loved everything!"

41338909,668877746,2020-09-27,252496306,Ken,"We just spent 4 weeks at Heather's place while house hunting in the area. This was truly a home away from home and Heather and husband Nick made us feel like royalty. Nothing was to big an ask and we are sad to be leaving. The 4 resident chickens were the icing on the cake. Highly, highly recommend if you want a true Salem experience. Lovely place, great neighborhood and amazing hosts."
41338909,702213704,2020-10-19,60492545,Alejandro,"Everything about Heather’s place is great. It’s everything you want an Air BnB to be. Good location, clean, and a nice space. Would stay here again in a heart beat."
41839968,643730642,2020-07-28,352533375,Michael,Manasse was a great host. Very polite and welcoming. This was my first Airbnb stay and it went very well. Very relaxing place to stay.
42075302,624693704,2020-05-13,170794049,Jamie,"The home was perfect for our extended stay. Communication was great. Overall, a great experience!"
42075302,633116408,2020-06-28,83740089,Regina,This was one of our favorite airbnb's. Such a nice home close to everything. House was very clean and comfortable well spaced out with plenty of room. My family enjoyed our stay we felt at home the entire time. Thank you so much Jose and Bryan.
42100848,620562446,2020-03-22,342126496,Bianca,"Rebecca’s was an exceptional host!
Her place just a charming. It’s like a well kept secret with the perfect amount of privacy as well as great park and town access. Rebecca had great communication which was so appreciated as this was my first time renting an Airbnb. If all hosts are as warm and welcoming as her, I can’t wait to have my next experience. I will note that we brought our dog and children and did not feel the home was very dog or kid friendly. Lots of fragile elements that made me feel I had to walk on eggshells a little and took away from my children’s experience. Also the neighbors have two large (aggressive breed) dogs so our dog was made to be confined as the other dog’s yard was not fenced in. We also weren’t allowed to have the dog upstairs in the loft per her request so he did have to stay leashed downstairs during the nighttime. All and all we loved the trip and think it would be a great place for couples get away. If you have children, I would say this place is more suitable for children over the age of 7."
42100848,621163291,2020-03-28,341901114,Joanna,Great place to stay! Excellent location close to hiking trails
42100848,621690839,2020-04-03,115684007,Jim,I had a very enjoyable stay.  Nice neighborhood.  Relaxing.
42100848,622382052,2020-04-13,338775516,Steph,It was very cozy and homey.  Had everything that we needed there.  It felt like we were out in the woods but still very close to town.   It was peaceful and loved hearing the birds.
42100848,622596943,2020-04-17,34641945,Tom,Wonderful hospitality.  They went the extra mile for me as I had difficulty opening the door due to a stupid error on my part and the owners husband graciously drove from Eugene to help me.  Lovely hosts and great place in an idyllic setting.  Good for work travel or vacation experience.
42100848,623190326,2020-04-26,236798662,Amber,We had a lovely time. We even saw deer.

42100848,624095009,2020-05-06,33596012,Patrick,I loved it! It made for the perfect getaway. The check in was easy and it was nice and tucked away which made for good privacy. The interior is comfortably decorated and the backyard adds a truly peaceful touch!
42100848,624252212,2020-05-08,345533786,Mary,"The host quickly responded to my request. She answered any questions that I had. The place...AMAZING doesn't even begin to describe it. It as such a warm, inviting feel to it from the moment you open the door. The layout and amenities surprised us at every turn. The location was perfect for just getting away. It is set on the outskirts of town so there isn't much to distract you from having a relaxing time. We will most definitely be going back. So much better than traditional hotels. You should absolutely check it out."
42100848,624439666,2020-05-10,81317817,Gabby,Location was perfect! House was clean and smelled nice. 10/10 would recommend :)
42100848,624961566,2020-05-16,42646726,Tom,"What a charming little country house! Perfectly positioned for maximum privacy, we felt like we were in the middle of nowhere all by ourselves. Great romantic couples spot."
42100848,626023451,2020-05-24,177053443,Nicholas,"Beautiful home in a nice part of town! We had some oversight issues during our stay, but I'm sure the host will be able to address these in the future. They were very nice and responsive. 

Would recommend, just do a walk-through before you settle in."
42100848,626814978,2020-05-30,192607375,Chance,Everything about this place is amazing. We will definitely try to book this place again when we come back to town.
42100848,627868373,2020-06-05,69869096,Cassandra,cute space with a nice balcony. We booked because it’s secluded and has a hot tub but unfortunately the hot tub didn’t work for our trip either. Looking at the reviews and responses  I guessed the water level was still too low to heat.
42100848,629759213,2020-06-14,271571037,Theresa,"Just as it was described.  A perfect place to relax.  We stayed for a week because our daughter was getting married.  Although out of town, it is close to all kinds of shopping and restaurants.  I would gladly stay here again when we come up to visit our daughter."
42100848,631707803,2020-06-23,201093151,Ashley,"Going in order by space:
The balcony was wonderful, the door a little stiff, 4 chairs but two are sun damaged and ripping. 

The yard was perfect for us and our dogs. I do think in the future They should warn guests as to what day the lawn maintenance happens since that was an unpleasant interruption with quite a bit of noise during our remote working hours. We were glad it didn’t happen while we were out enjoying coffee with the dogs or we all would have been caught quite off guard. I also might not advertise the garden boxes as a selling point since they’re empty with a few weeds. The flowers on the property were gorgeous though, and we made fresh cut vases for our stay. 

Breakfast included was also another thing we were very confused about. There was a variety of partially used, unopened, and expired food that made it unclear what they intended. There was an unopened loaf of frozen bread and fresh gallon of orange juice which we appreciated, but the rest we were hoping was an accident or oversight. There was a carton of eggs with 4 left, frozen hash browns with two left that were open to the air in the fridge, month old expired condiments, partially used butters, opened/ used creamer, Half drank flavored water, partially eaten loaf of bread on the counter, and partial container of ice cream in freezer. From a food safety standpoint , and particularly amongst COVID, we hope they weren’t intending those items as “included”. However, a loaf of bread and orange juice is hardly breakfast. We got no response about this when we messaged her and we didn’t particularly want anyone bringing groceries over anyway since we were wanting to avoid contact on our stay. 
The bathrooms and kitchen were stocked with the necessary soaps and cleaners, but it was a little odd  and gross that there were used bar soaps in the showers, and again I hope that wasn’t their intention since there was a body wash dispenser for use too. 

We didn’t see the recycling can that was mentioned in the house rules, and we didn’t really know where to put our trash since there wasn’t a can outside. We were just going to wait until the end of our stay and ask where they wanted it, but we were happy that they asked about it and were able to pick it up on a day we were out exploring. Still could’ve been in the house rules to avoid having to message about it. 

We had a wonderful time during our stay and very much enjoyed the Minto Brown park, Ventis cafe and Big Wig donuts. We obviously spent quite a bit of time at the vineyards, and also made a day trip to the coast and silver falls. 

Since they’re so close to the wine region you might check out Alaskan Airlines Wines Fly Free or the Digital Wine Passport:

We had time for 13 vineyards and got free tastings at all of them with the above mentioned links.

42100848,633144807,2020-06-28,332963914,Katy,"We really enjoyed staying here! Stayed for 5 nights so we could visit our family. Great location for us. Was really nice to be able to bring our dogs with us. Even though it's in the city you feel like you're away from it all. Forested and feels very private. Hot tub is a plus. We were so busy but did manage to get in the hot tub once, very clean and well maintained. Home was clean and we appreciated the fresh flowers in the house. We had a few questions during our stay and Rebecca was quick to answer. We hope to stay here again as we often try and visit family in Salem."

42243993,624767569,2020-05-14,1865205,Alana,Simple place with everything we needed! Enjoyed the river view and the Roku TV. Nice hot shower and plenty of space.
42243993,625634426,2020-05-22,189689490,Jeff,"First off... The negatives. Calling it a condo is a bit misleading. It's a unit in an apartment complex near a homeless hub. There was a homeless guy just outside the parking lot sleeping on an old couch. The internet didn't work for us in any of the bedrooms or the master bathroom. Had to use devices only in the living room. With that out of the way.... The inside is nice, clean and stylish. The glass doors leading to the balcony drown out the sound of the creek in the back if you don't want to hear it but also allow you to take it in when you're ready for it. Very clean and located close to a McDonald's and Safeway as well as the downtown mall even though that was closed. Body and hair care products were provided and felt nice. Lots of towels were on hand. Overall... I enjoyed my stay and the communication was second to none. Would recommend"

Having curtains inside the room will greatly help block out the early morning sun during summer. Out of our 3 days stay, we heard a train passed by and it made a lot of noise but overall, we are happy we found this place and hoping to come back again in the future..."

My favorite little extra  was the Mini Blue Bunny Ice Cream Cones that we’re in the freezer. Great great touch. Our host was a great communicator. This will be the only place i book going forward when i go to Salem. Just a great place!!"
42243993,637920444,2020-07-13,271402635,Swanna,This place is a perfect stay! My friends and I came across this place after taking a spontaneous adventure and decided to find a stay quite quickly.

42243993,661319865,2020-09-06,311673580,Emily,"Super cute updated apartment. A really great space and cute balcony with a view of the creek. Amanda provided tons of information and tips for the trip. The location is very close to down town which is super convenient, she is very honest about the cons of the location. I didn’t find it to be any worse than staying in another cities downtown area. 
My one problem about the apartment was the very strong smell of cigarette smoke in the house.
Even with that being said I would still recommend this Airbnb."

42243993,671653262,2020-10-05,101726895,Roselyn,Stopped off here for a night on our way to Astoria. We arrived late and left early so I can’t really speak to the location but we found the apartment to be clean spacious and comfortable.  The outside of the building is a little run down but don’t let that put  you off because inside the apartment is really nice. If we had had more time I would have enjoyed coffee on the balcony by the creek this morning.

42461489,651643226,2020-08-15,2072627,Paul,Lots of small details that made the visit great for our stop in Salem. Angela was a great host and we enjoyed the space!
42461489,661945286,2020-09-07,1930351,Will,"Immaculate, recently remodeled space with comfy couches, chairs, beds and towels. House is on a cul de sac, walking distance to grocery stores and restaurants. Salem is a nice host, and makes for a good jumping off point to state parks and wineries. Owner and manager were super on top of things and were gracious hosts. Why not 5 stars? Well, I'm picky. I cook, so could use more kitchen stuff to make that happen (Tupperware, tin foil, more bowls, cups, etc.) The space is a little tight, low ceilings, etc. The next-door neighbor and his two large dogs send out a less than super friendly vibe that made it tough to enjoy the back deck."
42796228,619889941,2020-03-19,173535193,Sarah,The house was adorable! Freshly renovated and was perfect for a mini get away in the middle of this crazy time.

42796228,661321201,2020-09-06,221290899,Andrea,"Matthew is such an amazing host! Words can’t express how quick to respond and kind he was to us when we had to evacuate home during the Californian-fires of 2020. We had ended up in a Portland location we weren’t comfortable in and found Matthew’s place after searching for a place that felt much safer and Matthew was quick to help us out.

He called and we told him the situation, then he quickly helped us book an earlier time in the Airbnb app and made sure when we arrived a few days early that the place was not only spotless but he had also left us a thoughtful letter and a bottle of wine, it finally felt like after weeks of hardship back in California, we were feeling good about things again.

The fast internet, well set up kitchen, and cozy living room made it easy for three business people to both work remotely and still be comfortable. I highly recommend Matthew’s place if you’re a business person seeking easy access to the highway, amazing internet, and a super host who will not only accommodate your needs but also effectively communicate and make your stay problem free so you can focus on work or leisure!

Tons of cute restaurants nearby, we loved settling in at night around the fire pit or sitting inside and watching movies while ordering pie from the Shari’s nearby. Enjoy!"
42796228,661819653,2020-09-07,106351657,Akash,"The host was very welcoming. I enjoyed the small mint chocolates kept in the room , plus the wine :)"

42796228,668157567,2020-09-26,183739587,Susan,Matthew was very caring for two weeks when two of our family homes burnt down in the Oregon Wildfires. We were in stock and homeless. He helped make us feel right at home. Greatly appreciated!
42796228,701853586,2020-10-18,229481694,Stephanie,"Matthew’s place was a perfect weekend home away from home. The house was easy to find, easy to access, thoroughly cleaned and well organized, and quite comfortable. There were thoughtful touches throughout the house to make the stay more comfortable (makeup remover wipes, extra toiletries, coffee creamer, etc.). I was happy to find fans for white noise as well! My teenagers were happy with the great WiFi and plenty of pillows. The house is also perfectly located for easy travel to shopping and local sightseeing. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable home base while traveling with a small family or on business."

42818351,640647544,2020-07-20,356112927,Rebecca,"Michael was a very nice and friendly guy. Unfortunately we were most looking forward to the pool, and it was in process of switching chemical cleaners so we were unable to use it. Michael was super understanding and let us get a full refund and find a new spot to stay, if the pool had been useable this would’ve been a great getaway."
42818351,643451431,2020-07-27,345484492,Valarie,"My husband and I stayed in this lovely apartment space for our honeymoon! 

The apartment itself was much more spacious than we had anticipated. I really loved how much natural lighting came into the apartment. It was also very clean and well put together.

Besides the space itself, we really enjoyed that we were staying so close to downtown Salem (about 5 minutes away). There are so many things to do downtown, we easily spent two days of our trip roaming around the city. 

Michael was a great host! He was always quick to respond, and even left us a nice surprise for when we checked in! He also took the time to give us a few recommendations for our week long trip.

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
42818351,643707472,2020-07-28,141539889,Scott,"Michael was a very hospitable host who greeted me upon my arrival, made sure I had everything I needed, and even gave me some local food recommendations. Place is air conditioned so it always feels cool, and the bed was super comfy."

42944382,623676225,2020-05-02,194068031,Sherah,"Absolutely loved staying here! We live in the country, so having restaurants and stores within walking distance was a special treat. The outside doesn’t look like much but it is a cute cozy little cottage once you step across the threshold.

The couch is super comfy, and a complimentary bottle of wine was chilling in the fridge upon arrival. Gorgeously updated home with original wood floors, and the backyard was BEAUTIFUL. 

Angela was quick to answer within minutes anytime I needed something, and even dropped off a bag of items (extension cord, batteries, lightbulbs) I needed within record time. Highly recommend."

42944382,653251095,2020-08-18,212725305,Amy,"Angels told us we left the place a disaster. We had towels from the morning and coffee cups from the morning. Otherwise, the place was clean. She accused us of breaking a blind in the living room. She stated it was lying on the floor which it was not when we left. There is a man across the street who watches the place. He came over when we arrived and asked us questions. We were freaked out by this. He told Angela there was a child in the house. We had NO children in the house. Angela states hE writes down everyone licenses plates who visits.  Creepy!"
